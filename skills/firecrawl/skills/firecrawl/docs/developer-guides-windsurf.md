# MCP Web Search & Scrape in Windsurf

> Add web scraping and search to Windsurf in 2 minutes

Add Firecrawl's keyless Search, Scrape, and Parse tools to Windsurf through the hosted MCP server.

## Quick setup

Open **Settings → Tools → Windsurf Settings → Add Server** or edit `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "url": "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Windsurf and confirm that `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, and `firecrawl_parse` are available.

Keyless access has limits shared by users on the same public IP. Sign in from an interactive client with [For Humans](/mcp-server/oauth), or [add an API key](/mcp-server/keyless#add-an-api-key) for unattended use.

## Try it

```text theme={null}
Search for the latest Tailwind CSS release notes and summarize the sources.
```

```text theme={null}
Scrape https://firecrawl.dev and explain what it does.
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Server does not connect:** confirm the hosted URL and inspect Windsurf's MCP status.
* **Crawl or another tool is missing:** keyless exposes exactly Search, Scrape, and Parse. Connect with OAuth or an API key for the broader tool surface.
