# Connect Firecrawl MCP

> Choose account OAuth, unattended API-key, or keyless Firecrawl MCP setup.

Use the hosted Firecrawl MCP service in one of three modes. Choose based on whether a person can sign in and whether the client can securely store an API key.

## Connect an account

Use this mode for an interactive, OAuth-capable client such as Claude or Codex. Add this URL to the client; it discovers Firecrawl's authorization metadata, opens the browser, and asks you to approve the team it should use.

```text theme={null}
https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp-oauth
```

The client receives short-lived, resource-bound tokens rather than your Firecrawl API key. You can review and revoke access from [MCP settings](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings?tab=mcp).


  If the client asks for an OAuth Client ID or Client Secret, leave both blank. Compatible clients use Client ID Metadata Documents or Dynamic Client Registration.


## Run unattended

Use this mode for CI, servers, scripts, or any runtime without a browser. Keep the API key in an environment variable or secret store and send it as an Authorization header.

```text theme={null}
https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp
Authorization: Bearer <FIRECRAWL_API_KEY>
```

This uses the full Firecrawl MCP tool surface. New configurations should not put an API key in the URL or commit it to a project configuration file.

## Try keyless

Use this mode to try Firecrawl without an account or API key:

```text theme={null}
https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp
```

Keyless MCP is rate-limited per IP and exposes exactly **Search, Scrape, and Parse** while eligible. Connect an account or use an API key when you need the complete tool surface or higher limits.

## Pick the right mode

| Mode       | Endpoint        | Available tools                                                 | Best for                                            | Credentials                                 |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Account    | `/v2/mcp-oauth` | Full MCP tool surface, subject to plan and feature availability | Interactive clients that can complete browser OAuth | OAuth tokens managed by the client          |
| Unattended | `/v2/mcp`       | Full MCP tool surface, subject to plan and feature availability | CI, servers, and scripts                            | `Authorization: Bearer <FIRECRAWL_API_KEY>` |
| Keyless    | `/v2/mcp`       | Search, Scrape, and Parse only                                  | A limited trial                                     | None                                        |

See [Tools and operations](/mcp-server/tools) for the current tool inventory and local/self-hosted availability notes.

## Client-specific help

See [client setup](/mcp-server/clients) for configuration examples. If your client cannot complete a remote OAuth flow, use the unattended header-based configuration or keyless mode instead. If it cannot send custom headers either, see the legacy fallback below.

## Legacy API-key URL support


  This legacy form exists only for existing configurations and clients that cannot complete OAuth or send a custom Authorization header. It is not the recommended setup for new integrations.


```text theme={null}
https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/<FIRECRAWL_API_KEY>/v2/mcp
```

The API key is part of the URL, so treat the complete URL like a password. Prefer account OAuth or an environment-backed `Authorization: Bearer` header whenever the client supports either. If this URL is exposed, rotate the API key. Never paste it into chat, screenshots, issues, or shared configuration.

This fallback applies only to the full `/v2/mcp` surface. It does not work for the OAuth-only search resource.

## Compatibility during migration

Existing `/v2/mcp` OAuth connections remain supported during the migration to the dedicated account endpoint. New interactive account connections should use `/v2/mcp-oauth`; new tokens for that account resource are not accepted by `/v2/mcp`.
