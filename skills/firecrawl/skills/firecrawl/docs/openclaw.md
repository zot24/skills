# OpenClaw

> Use Firecrawl with OpenClaw to give your agents web scraping, search, and browser automation capabilities.

Integrate Firecrawl with OpenClaw to give your agents the ability to scrape, search, crawl, extract, and interact with the web — all through the [Firecrawl CLI](/sdks/cli).

## Why Firecrawl + OpenClaw

* **No local browser needed** — every session runs in a remote, isolated sandbox. No Chromium installs, no driver conflicts, no RAM pressure on your machine.
* **Real parallelism** — run many browser sessions at once without local resource fights. Agents can browse in batches across multiple sites simultaneously.
* **Secure by default** — navigation, DOM evaluation, and extraction all happen inside disposable sandboxes, not on your workstation.
* **Better token economics** — agents get back clean artifacts (snapshots, extracted fields) instead of hauling giant DOMs and driver logs into the context window.
* **Full web toolkit** — scrape, search, and browser automation all through a single CLI that your agent already knows how to use.

## Setup

Tell your agent to install the Firecrawl CLI, authenticate and initialize the skill with this command:

```bash
npx -y firecrawl-cli init --browser --all
```

* `--all` installs the Firecrawl skill to every detected AI coding agent
* `--browser` opens the browser for Firecrawl authentication automatically

or install everything seperately:

```bash
npm install -g firecrawl-cli
firecrawl init skills
firecrawl login --browser
# Or, skip the browser and provide your API key directly:
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="fc-YOUR-API-KEY"
```

Verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash
firecrawl --status
```


  Once the skill is installed, your OpenClaw agent automatically discovers and uses Firecrawl commands — no extra configuration needed.


## Scrape

Scrape a single page and extract its content:

```bash
firecrawl https://example.com --only-main-content
```

Get specific formats:

```bash
firecrawl https://example.com --format markdown,links --pretty
```

## Search

Search the web and optionally scrape the results:

```bash
firecrawl search "latest AI funding rounds 2025" --limit 10

# Search and scrape the results
firecrawl search "OpenClaw documentation" --scrape --scrape-formats markdown
```

## Browser

Launch a remote browser session for interactive automation. Each session runs in an isolated sandbox — no local Chromium install required. `agent-browser` is pre-installed with 40+ commands.

```bash
# Shorthand: auto-launches a session if none is active
firecrawl browser "open https://news.ycombinator.com"
firecrawl browser "snapshot"
firecrawl browser "scrape"
firecrawl browser close
```

Interact with page elements using refs from the snapshot:

```bash
firecrawl browser "open https://example.com"
firecrawl browser "snapshot"
# snapshot returns @ref IDs — use them to interact
firecrawl browser "click @e5"
firecrawl browser "fill @e3 'search query'"
firecrawl browser "scrape"
firecrawl browser close
```


  The shorthand form (`firecrawl browser "..."`) sends commands to `agent-browser` automatically and auto-launches a sandbox session if there isn't one active. Your agent issues intent-level actions (`open`, `click`, `fill`, `snapshot`, `scrape`) instead of writing Playwright code.


## Example: tell your agent

Here are some prompts you can give your OpenClaw agent:

* *"Use Firecrawl to scrape [https://example.com](https://example.com) and summarize the main content."*
* *"Search for the latest OpenAI news and give me a summary of the top 5 results."*
* *"Use Firecrawl Browser to open Hacker News, get the top 5 stories, and the first 10 comments on each."*
* *"Crawl the docs at [https://docs.firecrawl.dev](https://docs.firecrawl.dev) and save them to a file."*
