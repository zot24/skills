# Firecrawl MCP tools and operations

> Available tools, operational behavior, and error handling for Firecrawl MCP.

The tools listed here describe the full Firecrawl MCP server surface. Tool availability depends on how you connect.

| Connection mode                  | Tool availability                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hosted account OAuth             | Full tool surface, subject to plan and feature availability              |
| Hosted API key                   | Full tool surface, subject to plan and feature availability              |
| Hosted keyless                   | `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, and `firecrawl_parse` only       |
| Local MCP with a cloud API key   | API-backed tools; direct local-file Parse requires a self-hosted API URL |
| Local MCP with a self-hosted API | Tools supported by the services enabled in that deployment               |


  Some optional tools can be disabled by environment or team policy. Start with [Connect Firecrawl MCP](/mcp-server/connect) to choose an authentication mode, and see [Rate limits](/rate-limits#keyless-no-api-key) for the current keyless allowance.


## Available Tools

### 1. Scrape Tool (`firecrawl_scrape`)

Scrape content from a single URL with advanced options.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_scrape",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "formats": ["markdown"],
    "onlyMainContent": true,
    "waitFor": 1000,
    "mobile": false,
    "includeTags": ["article", "main"],
    "excludeTags": ["nav", "footer"],
    "skipTlsVerification": false
  }
}
```

To redact personally identifiable information, include `redactPII` in the scrape tool arguments.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_scrape",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com/contact",
    "formats": ["markdown"],
    "redactPII": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Map Tool (`firecrawl_map`)

Map a website to discover all indexed URLs on the site.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_map",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "search": "blog",
    "sitemap": "include",
    "includeSubdomains": false,
    "limit": 100,
    "ignoreQueryParameters": true
  }
}
```

#### Map Tool Options:

* `url`: The base URL of the website to map
* `search`: Optional search term to filter URLs
* `sitemap`: Control sitemap usage - "include", "skip", or "only"
* `includeSubdomains`: Whether to include subdomains in the mapping
* `limit`: Maximum number of URLs to return
* `ignoreQueryParameters`: Whether to ignore query parameters when mapping

**Best for:** Discovering URLs on a website before deciding what to scrape; finding specific sections of a website.
**Returns:** Array of URLs found on the site.

### 3. Search Tool (`firecrawl_search`)

Search the web and optionally extract content from search results.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_search",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "your search query",
    "limit": 5,
    "location": "United States",
    "tbs": "qdr:m",
    "scrapeOptions": {
      "formats": ["markdown"],
      "onlyMainContent": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Search Tool Options:

* `query`: The search query string (required)
* `limit`: Maximum number of results to return
* `location`: Geographic location for search results
* `tbs`: Time-based search filter (e.g., `qdr:d` for past day, `qdr:w` for past week, `qdr:m` for past month)
* `filter`: Additional search filter
* `sources`: Array of source types to search (`web`, `images`, `news`)
* `scrapeOptions`: Options for scraping search result pages
* `enterprise`: Array of enterprise options (`default`, `anon`, `zdr`)

### 3b. Search Feedback Tool (`firecrawl_search_feedback`)

Send structured feedback after using `firecrawl_search`. The first feedback submission for a search ID can refund one credit, subject to the daily team cap.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_search_feedback",
  "arguments": {
    "searchId": "search-id-from-firecrawl-search",
    "rating": "good",
    "valuableSources": [
      {
        "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mcp-server",
        "reason": "Contains the current connection guidance."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Set `FIRECRAWL_NO_SEARCH_FEEDBACK=1` to prevent this optional tool from being registered.

### 3c. Generic Feedback Tool (`firecrawl_feedback`)

Send concise endpoint-level feedback for completed Scrape, Parse, Map, or Search jobs. Do not include raw scraped or parsed content.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_feedback",
  "arguments": {
    "endpoint": "scrape",
    "jobId": "job-id",
    "rating": "partial",
    "issues": ["missing_markdown"],
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

Use `firecrawl_search_feedback` for search-result quality. Set `FIRECRAWL_NO_ENDPOINT_FEEDBACK=1` to prevent the generic feedback tool from being registered.

### 4. Parse Tool (`firecrawl_parse`)

Parse a local file such as a PDF, DOCX, XLSX, or HTML document into clean, LLM-ready data.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_parse",
  "arguments": {
    "filePath": "/absolute/path/to/report.pdf",
    "formats": ["markdown"]
  }
}
```

When you run Firecrawl MCP locally against a Firecrawl API instance with `FIRECRAWL_API_URL`, the MCP server can read `filePath` directly and sends the file bytes to `/v2/parse`.

When you use the remote hosted MCP server, the hosted server cannot read files from your machine. In that case `firecrawl_parse` uses a two-step handoff that also works on the remote keyless URL:

1. Call `firecrawl_parse` with `filePath`. The tool returns a pre-filled upload command and a `nextToolCall` containing an `uploadRef`.
2. Run the upload command on the machine that can read the file, then call `firecrawl_parse` again with the returned `uploadRef`.

The upload command sends the file bytes to a short-lived signed upload target. It does not include your Firecrawl API key.

#### Parse Tool Options:

* `filePath`: Local path to the file you want to parse. Use this for the first call.
* `uploadRef`: Reference returned by the first hosted-MCP call. Use this for the second call after the upload succeeds.
* `formats`: Output formats. Defaults to `markdown`.
* `parsers`: Parser controls, such as PDF parsing options.
* `contentType`: Optional file MIME type override.
* `declaredSizeBytes`: Optional file size hint. Files are limited to 50 MB.

**Best for:** Local or non-public documents that are not available at a public URL.

**Not recommended for:** Public document URLs. Use `firecrawl_scrape` instead; it will detect and parse documents from URLs.

### 5. Crawl Tool (`firecrawl_crawl`)

Start an asynchronous crawl with advanced options.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_crawl",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "maxDiscoveryDepth": 2,
    "limit": 100,
    "allowExternalLinks": false,
    "deduplicateSimilarURLs": true
  }
}
```

### 6. Check Crawl Status (`firecrawl_check_crawl_status`)

Check the status of a crawl job.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_check_crawl_status",
  "arguments": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }
}
```

**Returns:** Status and progress of the crawl job, including results if available.

### 7. Extract Tool (`firecrawl_extract`)

Extract structured information from web pages using LLM capabilities. Supports both cloud AI and self-hosted LLM extraction.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_extract",
  "arguments": {
    "urls": ["https://example.com/page1", "https://example.com/page2"],
    "prompt": "Extract product information including name, price, and description",
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "price": { "type": "number" },
        "description": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["name", "price"]
    },
    "allowExternalLinks": false,
    "enableWebSearch": false,
    "includeSubdomains": false
  }
}
```

Example response:

```json theme={null}
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": {
        "name": "Example Product",
        "price": 99.99,
        "description": "This is an example product description"
      }
    }
  ],
  "isError": false
}
```

#### Extract Tool Options:

* `urls`: Array of URLs to extract information from
* `prompt`: Custom prompt for the LLM extraction
* `schema`: JSON schema for structured data extraction
* `allowExternalLinks`: Allow extraction from external links
* `enableWebSearch`: Enable web search for additional context
* `includeSubdomains`: Include subdomains in extraction

When using a self-hosted instance, the extraction will use your configured LLM. For cloud API, it uses Firecrawl's managed LLM service.

### 8. Agent Tool (`firecrawl_agent`)

Autonomous web research agent that independently browses the internet, searches for information, navigates through pages, and extracts structured data based on your query. This runs asynchronously -- it returns a job ID immediately, and you poll `firecrawl_agent_status` to check when complete and retrieve results.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_agent",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Find the top 5 AI startups founded in 2024 and their funding amounts",
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "startups": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "name": { "type": "string" },
              "funding": { "type": "string" },
              "founded": { "type": "string" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also provide specific URLs for the agent to focus on:

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_agent",
  "arguments": {
    "urls": ["https://docs.firecrawl.dev", "https://firecrawl.dev/pricing"],
    "prompt": "Compare the features and pricing information from these pages"
  }
}
```

#### Agent Tool Options:

* `prompt`: Natural language description of the data you want (required, max 10,000 characters)
* `urls`: Optional array of URLs to focus the agent on specific pages
* `schema`: Optional JSON schema for structured output

**Best for:** Complex research tasks where you don't know the exact URLs; multi-source data gathering; finding information scattered across the web; extracting data from JavaScript-heavy SPAs that fail with regular scrape.

**Returns:** Job ID for status checking. Use `firecrawl_agent_status` to poll for results.

### 9. Check Agent Status (`firecrawl_agent_status`)

Check the status of an agent job and retrieve results when complete. Poll every 15-30 seconds and keep polling for at least 2-3 minutes before considering the request failed.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_agent_status",
  "arguments": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }
}
```

#### Agent Status Options:

* `id`: The agent job ID returned by `firecrawl_agent` (required)

**Possible statuses:**

* `processing`: Agent is still researching -- keep polling
* `completed`: Research finished -- response includes the extracted data
* `failed`: An error occurred

**Returns:** Status, progress, and results (if completed) of the agent job.

### 10. Interact with a Page (`firecrawl_interact`)

Interact with a page in a live browser session: click buttons, fill forms, extract dynamic content, or navigate deeper.

Use one of two targeting modes:

* Pass `url` to open and interact with a fresh page in one MCP call.
* Pass `scrapeId` from a previous `firecrawl_scrape` call to reuse the already-loaded page.

Do not pass both `url` and `scrapeId`. Provide either `prompt` or `code`. `scrapeOptions` can only be used with `url` mode.

**URL mode example:**

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_interact",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com/products",
    "prompt": "Click on the first product and tell me its price"
  }
}
```

**Scrape reuse example:**

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_interact",
  "arguments": {
    "scrapeId": "scrape-id-from-previous-scrape",
    "prompt": "Click the Sign In button"
  }
}
```

#### Interact Tool Options:

* `url`: Page to interact with; opens the session for you. Use this or `scrapeId`.
* `scrapeId`: Scrape job ID from a previous `firecrawl_scrape` call. Use this or `url`.
* `prompt`: Natural language instruction describing the action to take. Provide `prompt` or `code`.
* `code`: Code to execute in the browser session. Provide `code` or `prompt`.
* `language`: `bash`, `python`, or `node` (optional, defaults to `node`, only used with `code`).
* `timeout`: Execution timeout in seconds, 1–300 (optional, defaults to 30).
* `scrapeOptions`: Optional scrape controls used only with `url` mode.

**Best for:** Multi-step workflows on a single page — searching a site, clicking through results, filling forms, extracting data that requires interaction.

**Returns:** Interaction result including output and live view URLs.

### 11. Stop Interact Session (`firecrawl_interact_stop`)

Stop an interact session for a scraped page. Call this when you are done interacting to free resources.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_interact_stop",
  "arguments": {
    "scrapeId": "scrape-id-from-previous-scrape"
  }
}
```

#### Interact Stop Options:

* `scrapeId`: The scrape ID for the session to stop (required)

**Returns:** Confirmation that the session has been stopped.

### 12. Research Tools (`firecrawl_research_*`)

Use the read-only research tools for literature review, paper inspection, citation discovery, and public GitHub repository search.

| Tool                                | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `firecrawl_research_search_papers`  | Search research papers                   |
| `firecrawl_research_inspect_paper`  | Inspect one paper's metadata and details |
| `firecrawl_research_related_papers` | Find papers related to an anchor paper   |
| `firecrawl_research_read_paper`     | Read available paper content             |
| `firecrawl_research_search_github`  | Search public GitHub repositories        |

These tools are not part of the hosted keyless surface.

### 13. Monitor Tools (`firecrawl_monitor_*`)

Create and manage recurring page monitors. Monitors run scheduled checks, compare results with retained snapshots, and can notify through webhooks or email.

```json theme={null}
{
  "name": "firecrawl_monitor_create",
  "arguments": {
    "page": "https://example.com/pricing",
    "goal": "Alert when pricing, packaging, or launch messaging changes."
  }
}
```

| Tool                       | Purpose                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `firecrawl_monitor_create` | Create a page or crawl monitor        |
| `firecrawl_monitor_list`   | List monitors                         |
| `firecrawl_monitor_get`    | Get one monitor                       |
| `firecrawl_monitor_update` | Update a monitor                      |
| `firecrawl_monitor_run`    | Trigger a check now                   |
| `firecrawl_monitor_delete` | Delete a monitor                      |
| `firecrawl_monitor_checks` | List checks for a monitor             |
| `firecrawl_monitor_check`  | Get one page-level check and its diff |


  `firecrawl_monitor_delete` permanently removes a monitor. An MCP client should call it only when the user explicitly intends to delete that monitor.


## Logging System

```

## Error Handling

The server provides robust error handling:

* Automatic retries for transient errors
* Rate limit handling with backoff
* Detailed error messages
* Credit usage warnings
* Network resilience

Example error response:

```json theme={null}
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Error: Rate limit exceeded. Retrying in 2 seconds..."
    }
  ],
  "isError": true
}
```
