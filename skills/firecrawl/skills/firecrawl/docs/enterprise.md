# Enterprise

> Enterprise plans, security, and features for Firecrawl at scale

Firecrawl Enterprise is built for teams that need to run the web at scale with strict security, compliance, and support requirements. Enterprise plans include everything in our self-serve plans plus custom credits, dedicated support, and the security and access controls below.


  Enterprise features are provisioned by our team. To enable them or discuss a custom plan, visit the [Enterprise page](https://www.firecrawl.dev/enterprise) or reach out to [help@firecrawl.dev](mailto:help@firecrawl.dev).


## Security & compliance

* **SOC 2 Type II**: Independently audited security controls covering data protection and operational security.
* **Zero Data Retention (ZDR)**: Page content and extracted data are processed in-memory and never persisted beyond the lifetime of the request. Available for both scraping ([Scrape ZDR](/features/scrape#zero-data-retention-zdr)) and search ([Search ZDR](/features/search#zero-data-retention-zdr)), including an end-to-end mode where our upstream search provider also enforces ZDR.
* **PII redaction**: Automatically redact personally identifiable information from scrape and parse output. See [PII redaction](/features/scrape#pii-redaction).
* **DPA & custom contracts**: Data Processing Agreements, custom MSAs, and security reviews to meet your procurement requirements.

## Identity & access management

* **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: SAML and OIDC single sign-on so your team authenticates through your existing identity provider (Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace, and more).
* **SCIM directory sync**: Automatically provision and deprovision users from your directory so access stays in sync with your org.
* **Static IP allowlisting**: Route your traffic through dedicated, whitelisted IP addresses for allowlisting on your systems.
* **[IP restrictions](/features/ip-restrictions)**: Restrict your team's API keys to an allowlist of IP addresses or CIDR ranges so they only work from approved networks.
* **[Key restrictions](/features/key-restrictions)**: Lock individual API keys to specific output formats and endpoints, enforced server-side with no request-level override.

## Scale & performance

* **Custom credit volumes**: Credit allotments sized to your usage, beyond the standard Scale tier.
* **Pooled credits across teams**: Group multiple teams under one organization and share a single credit pool across them, with per-team usage tracking and reporting.
* **Spend limits**: Set spending caps per API key or per team to keep usage and costs under control.
* **Custom concurrency**: Concurrent browser limits tailored to your workload for maximum throughput. See [Rate Limits](/rate-limits).
* **Reserved concurrency**: Dedicate a portion of your concurrent browser capacity to specific teams or workloads, so high-priority jobs are never starved by other traffic.
* **Extended credit rollover**: Credits from annual Scale and Enterprise plans allow for some rollover, instead of expiring at the end of the month. See [Billing](/billing).
* **Bulk discounts**: Volume-based pricing for large commitments.
