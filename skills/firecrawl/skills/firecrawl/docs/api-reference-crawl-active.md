            value, the page will be scraped. If you do not need extremely fresh

             - **auto**: Firecrawl will automatically retry scraping with enhanced proxies if the basic proxy fails. If the retry with enhanced is successful, 5 credits will be billed for the scrape. If the first attempt with basic is successful, only the regular cost will be billed.

            Setting this to false is useful if your scraping activity may have
            data protection concerns. Using some parameters associated with
            sensitive scraping (e.g. actions, headers) will force this parameter

            returns a 404 with error code SCRAPE_LOCKDOWN_CACHE_MISS (the URL is
            never logged on miss). Lockdown requests are treated as zero data
            retention. Default maxAge is extended to 2 years so existing cached
