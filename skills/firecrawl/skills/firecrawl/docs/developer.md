# Developer Index

> Search issues, merged pull requests, repository READMEs, and curated documentation sites

Firecrawl Developer is an index built for coding agents. It covers issues, merged pull requests, and READMEs from public code repositories, alongside curated documentation sites, so an agent can answer a question about code behavior, a library or framework, an API contract, an error message, or a known bug from primary sources rather than from a general web page.

* Find the issue or pull request where a bug was reported and fixed
* Read the passages of a README or a documentation page that answer one specific question
* Trace an API contract back to the pull request that changed it
* Recover the discussion behind an error message


  To give your agent access to the Developer Index, we strongly recommend using our [CLI](/sdks/cli) or [MCP](/mcp-server), combined with our [**dedicated developer skill**](https://github.com/firecrawl/cli/tree/main/skills/firecrawl-developer-index), which you can install with:

  ```bash
  npx -y firecrawl-cli@latest setup developer-index
  ```


## Endpoints

| Task                                  | Endpoint                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Search the developer index            | [`GET` or `POST /search/developer`](/api-reference/endpoint/developer-search)     |
| Add developer results to a web search | [`POST /search`](/api-reference/endpoint/search) with `categories: ["developer"]` |

## Search the developer index

Send a natural-language question and get back ranked developer results with the passages that matched. This is the path to reach for when you want developer sources only, with the result type, repository, and documentation source filters available.

A developer search costs 2 credits per 10 results, rounded up (1–10 results = 2 credits, 11–20 = 4 credits, and so on). No API key is needed to get started; add one for higher rate limits.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  # No API key needed to get started; add -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" for higher rate limits:
  curl -s "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search/developer?query=how%20do%20I%20configure%20retries&k=10"
  ```

  ```bash CLI
  firecrawl developer "how do I configure retries" --limit 10
  ```
</CodeGroup>

`POST` is available on the same path, and is the easier form when you want to pass array filters as JSON:

```bash cURL theme={null}
# No API key needed to get started; add -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" for higher rate limits:
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search/developer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "how do I configure retries",
    "k": 10,
    "types": ["issue", "pull_request"]
  }'
```

Each result carries a stable `id` such as `issue:owner/repo#123`, a `url`, and its matched `passages` in markdown, so tables and code blocks survive. The artifact kind is encoded in the `id` prefix: `doc:`, `issue:`, `pull_request:`, or `readme:`. `title` is frequently absent on `doc` results, where the source page carries no usable title, so fall back to `url` rather than assuming the field is present.

When you scope a search with `sources` or `repos`, the response echoes them back with an `indexed` flag per entry, so you can distinguish an id that is not in the index from a query that simply found nothing. See the [developer search reference](/api-reference/endpoint/developer-search) for the echo shape.

Optional filters narrow the search:

* `k` sets how many results come back, defaulting to 10, and `passages` how many matched passages each one carries
* `types` picks which of `doc`, `issue`, `pull_request`, and `readme` to search
* `repos` scopes the repository half of the index, and `sources` scopes the documentation half
* `skills` set to `only` limits the search to indexed agent-skill files
* `language`, `topic`, `license`, `min_stars`, `max_stars`, `archived`, and `fork` filter on repository attributes, such as `language=Rust`, `topic=async`, or `license=MIT`

Those seven filters describe a code repository, so sending one without a `sources` scope returns no `doc` results. Read [how the repository filters scope a search](/api-reference/endpoint/developer-search#how-the-repository-filters-scope-a-search) before you send one.

See the [developer search reference](/api-reference/endpoint/developer-search) for every filter's type and bounds, how `repos` and `sources` scope a search, and the full response schema.


  The Python and Node SDKs reach the Developer Index through the `developer` category shown below. They do not expose a dedicated method for this endpoint, so call it over HTTP, through the [CLI](/sdks/cli), or through [MCP](/mcp-server).


## Add developer results to a web search

Pass `developer` as the only entry in the `categories` array on `/search`. The response returns developer results in the standard `web` group, each tagged `category: "developer"`. The `developer` category cannot be combined with other categories.

No API key is needed to get started — `/search` accepts keyless requests, and the `developer` category comes with it, subject to the [keyless allowance](/rate-limits#keyless-no-api-key). Send a key for higher rate limits.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  # No API key needed to get started; add -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" for higher rate limits:
  curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "query": "how do I configure retries",
      "categories": ["developer"],
      "limit": 10
    }'
  ```

  ```bash CLI
  firecrawl search "how do I configure retries" --categories developer --limit 10
  ```

  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR-API-KEY")

  result = firecrawl.search(
      "how do I configure retries",
      categories=["developer"],
      limit=10,
  )
  for item in result.web or []:
      print(item.url, item.title)
  ```

  ```js Node
  import { Firecrawl } from "firecrawl";

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
    // No API key needed to get started; add one for higher rate limits:
    // apiKey: "fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  });

  const result = await firecrawl.search("how do I configure retries", {
    categories: ["developer"],
    limit: 10,
  });
  for (const item of result.web ?? []) {
    console.log(item.url, item.title);
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Developer results carry `url`, `title`, `description`, and `position`, the same shape as a web result, plus `category: "developer"`. SDK users read them from `result.web`.

This surface returns the web result shape, not the ranked developer shape. For the matched passages and the index filters, use the [developer search endpoint](#search-the-developer-index).


  The hosted [MCP server](/mcp-server) exposes both surfaces, and neither writes anything. See [MCP tools](/mcp-server/tools) for `firecrawl_developer_search`, for developer results through `firecrawl_search`, and for which of the two the keyless tool surface carries.
