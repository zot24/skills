# Use Firecrawl MCP in Claude

> Connect Claude to Firecrawl with OAuth

Add Firecrawl capabilities to Claude with a remote account connector.


  Looking for Claude Code setup? See the [Claude Code guide](/quickstarts/claude-code) instead.


## Quick Setup

### 1. Add a custom connector

Go to [Settings > Connectors](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors) in Claude.ai and click **Add custom connector**.

Fill in the connector details:

* **URL:** `https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp-oauth`
* **OAuth Client ID:** Leave blank
* **OAuth Client Secret:** Leave blank

Click **Add** to save the connector.

Claude opens Firecrawl in your browser. Sign in, choose the team to use, and approve access. Your raw API key is never placed in the connector URL. See [Connect an MCP Client to Your Account](/developer-guides/mcp-setup-guides/oauth) for the endpoint contract and other supported modes.

### 2. Enable in Conversation

In any Claude.ai conversation, click the **+** button at the bottom left, go to **Connectors**, and enable the Firecrawl connector.

## Quick Demo

With the Firecrawl connector enabled, try these prompts:

**Search the web:**

```
Search for the latest Next.js 15 features
```

**Scrape a page:**

```
Scrape firecrawl.dev and tell me what it does
```

**Get documentation:**

```
Find and scrape the Stripe API docs for payment intents
```

Claude will automatically use Firecrawl's search and scrape tools to get the information.
