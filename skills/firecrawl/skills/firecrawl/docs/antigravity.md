# MCP Web Search & Scrape in Antigravity

> Add Firecrawl web scraping and search to Google Antigravity

Add Firecrawl's keyless Search, Scrape, and Parse tools to [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) through the hosted MCP server.

## Quick setup

Open Antigravity settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`), search for **MCP Servers**, and add:

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "serverUrl": "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Reload the window and confirm that `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, and `firecrawl_parse` are available.

Keyless access has limits shared by users on the same public IP. Sign in from an interactive client with [For Humans](/mcp-server/oauth), or [add an API key](/mcp-server/keyless#add-an-api-key) for unattended use.

## Try it

```text theme={null}
Use Firecrawl to search for the latest Vercel AI SDK release notes and summarize the sources.
```

```text theme={null}
Scrape https://docs.firecrawl.dev/ai-onboarding and list the linked guides.
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Server shows as failed:** confirm the hosted URL and inspect the MCP output panel.
* **Crawl or another tool is missing:** keyless exposes exactly Search, Scrape, and Parse. Connect with OAuth or an API key for the broader tool surface.
