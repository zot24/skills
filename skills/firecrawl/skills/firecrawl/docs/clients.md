# Set up Firecrawl MCP in a client

> Client-specific configuration for the hosted and local Firecrawl MCP server.

Start with [Connect Firecrawl MCP](/mcp-server/connect) to choose account OAuth, unattended API-key access, or keyless access. These client-specific examples use that same mode-aware contract.

## Running on Cursor

Install the hosted keyless server in one click (no API key required):

<a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=firecrawl&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5maXJlY3Jhd2wuZGV2L3YyL21jcCJ9">
  <img src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.png" alt="Add Firecrawl MCP server to Cursor" style={{ maxHeight: 32 }} />

  <span className="fc-sr-only">Install Firecrawl MCP in Cursor</span>
</a>

Or add it to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` manually:

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "url": "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Running locally with an API key

Note: Requires Cursor version 0.45.6+
For the most up-to-date configuration instructions, please refer to the official Cursor documentation on configuring MCP servers:
[Cursor MCP Server Configuration Guide](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp)

To configure Firecrawl MCP in Cursor **v0.48.6**

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to Features > MCP Servers
3. Click "+ Add new global MCP server"
4. Enter the following code:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "firecrawl-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "YOUR-API-KEY"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

To configure Firecrawl MCP in Cursor **v0.45.6**

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to Features > MCP Servers
3. Click "+ Add New MCP Server"
4. Enter the following:
   * Name: "firecrawl-mcp" (or your preferred name)
   * Type: "command"
   * Command: `env FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key npx -y firecrawl-mcp@3.23.0`

> If you are using Windows and are running into issues, try `cmd /c "set FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key && npx -y firecrawl-mcp@3.23.0"`

Replace `your-api-key` with your Firecrawl API key. If you don't have one yet, you can create an account and get it from [https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys)

After adding, refresh the MCP server list to see the new tools. The Composer Agent will automatically use Firecrawl MCP when appropriate, but you can explicitly request it by describing your web data needs. Access the Composer via Command+L (Mac), select "Agent" next to the submit button, and enter your query.

## Running on Windsurf

Add this to your `./codeium/windsurf/model_config.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running with Streamable HTTP Mode

To run the server using streamable HTTP transport locally instead of the default stdio transport:

```bash theme={null}
env HTTP_STREAMABLE_SERVER=true FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-YOUR_API_KEY npx -y firecrawl-mcp@3.23.0
```

Use `http://localhost:3000/mcp` for the local server. The `/v2/mcp` route belongs to the hosted service at `https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp`.

Confirm the local process is ready before connecting a client:

```bash theme={null}
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

The health check returns `ok`. See [Run Firecrawl MCP locally](/mcp-server/local#run-with-streamable-http) for prerequisites and configuration.

## Installing via Smithery (Legacy)

To install Firecrawl for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@mendableai/mcp-server-firecrawl):

```bash theme={null}
npx -y @smithery/cli install @mendableai/mcp-server-firecrawl --client claude
```

## Running on VS Code

For one-click installation, click one of the install buttons below\...

[![Install with NPX in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-NPM-0098FF?style=flat-square\&logo=visualstudiocode\&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=firecrawl\&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22apiKey%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Firecrawl%20API%20Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D\&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22firecrawl-mcp%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22FIRECRAWL_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AapiKey%7D%22%7D%7D) [![Install with NPX in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-NPM-24bfa5?style=flat-square\&logo=visualstudiocode\&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=firecrawl\&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22apiKey%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Firecrawl%20API%20Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D\&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22firecrawl-mcp%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22FIRECRAWL_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AapiKey%7D%22%7D%7D\&quality=insiders)

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "apiKey",
        "description": "Firecrawl API Key",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "firecrawl": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
        "env": {
          "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "${input:apiKey}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others:

```json theme={null}
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "apiKey",
      "description": "Firecrawl API Key",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "${input:apiKey}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Some users have reported issues when adding the MCP server to VS Code due to how it validates JSON with an outdated schema format ([microsoft/vscode#155379](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/155379)).
This affects several MCP tools, including Firecrawl.

**Workaround:** Disable JSON validation in VS Code to allow the MCP server to load properly.
See reference: [directus/directus#25906 (comment)](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/25906#issuecomment-3369169513).

The MCP server still works fine when invoked via other extensions, but the issue occurs specifically when registering it directly in the MCP server list. We plan to add guidance once VS Code updates their schema validation.

## Running on Claude Desktop

For an interactive account connection, add the account endpoint and complete the browser OAuth flow:

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "url": "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp-oauth"
    }
  }
}
```

For an unattended or API-key-backed configuration, use `https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp` with an `Authorization: Bearer <FIRECRAWL_API_KEY>` header instead.

If you get a "Couldn't reach the MCP server" error, your Claude Desktop version may not support streamable HTTP transport. Use the local npx approach instead (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)):

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you see a `spawn npx ENOENT` error, Node.js is not installed or not in your system PATH. Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version), then fully restart Claude Desktop. On Windows, you can also run `where npx` in Command Prompt and use the full path (e.g. `C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd`) as the `command` value.

## Running on Claude Code

Add the Firecrawl MCP server using the Claude Code CLI. You can use the remote hosted URL or run locally:

```bash theme={null}
# Interactive account connection (recommended)
claude mcp add --transport http firecrawl https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp-oauth

# For an unattended API-key configuration, use an Authorization header
claude mcp add --transport http firecrawl https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <FIRECRAWL_API_KEY>"

# Or run locally via npx
claude mcp add firecrawl -e FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-your-api-key -- npx -y firecrawl-mcp@3.23.0
```

## Running on Google Antigravity

Google Antigravity allows you to configure MCP servers directly through its Agent interface.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/firecrawl/rxzXygFiVc0TDh5X/images/guides/mcp/antigravity-mcp-installation.gif?s=19297c26dad5ed191862571618ce8c0a" alt="Antigravity MCP Installation" width="1280" height="720" data-path="images/guides/mcp/antigravity-mcp-installation.gif" />

1. Open the Agent sidebar in the Editor or the Agent Manager view
2. Click the "..." (More Actions) menu and select **MCP Servers**
3. Select **View raw config** to open your local `mcp_config.json` file
4. Add the following configuration:

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file and click **Refresh** in the Antigravity MCP interface to see the new tools

Replace `YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` with your API key from [https://firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys).

## Running on n8n

To connect the Firecrawl MCP server in n8n:

1. Get your Firecrawl API key from [https://firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys)
2. In your n8n workflow, add an **AI Agent** node
3. In the AI Agent configuration, add a new **Tool**
4. Select **MCP Client Tool** as the tool type
5. Enter the MCP server Endpoint:

```
https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp
```

6. Set **Server Transport** to **HTTP Streamable**
7. Choose authentication:
   * Set **Authentication** to **Bearer** and paste your Firecrawl API key for the full MCP tool surface.
   * Leave **Authentication** as **None** for the keyless free tier, which exposes only Search, Scrape, and Parse.
8. For **Tools to include**, choose **All**, **Selected**, or **All Except** from the tools advertised for your authentication mode.

For self-hosted deployments, run the MCP server with npx and enable HTTP transport mode:

```bash theme={null}
env HTTP_STREAMABLE_SERVER=true \
    FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-YOUR_API_KEY \
    FIRECRAWL_API_URL=YOUR_FIRECRAWL_INSTANCE \
    npx -y firecrawl-mcp@3.23.0
```

This starts the server on `http://localhost:3000/mcp`, which you can use as the n8n endpoint. The `HTTP_STREAMABLE_SERVER=true` environment variable is required because n8n needs HTTP transport.
