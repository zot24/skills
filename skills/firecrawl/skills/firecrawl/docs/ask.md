# Debug Firecrawl with Ask

> Agentic debugging for your Firecrawl integration

Firecrawl `/support/ask` is an AI support agent exposed as an API. Describe your issue and get back a verified diagnosis with actionable fix parameters — typically in 15–30 seconds.

**Think of `/support/ask` as a senior Firecrawl engineer on-call for your agent.**


  The Ask API is designed primarily for **AI agent callers**. If you're building agents that use Firecrawl for scraping, crawling, or data extraction, wire `/support/ask` into your error-handling flow for autonomous issue resolution.


## Two endpoints

| Endpoint                    | Auth                   | Who it's for         | What it does                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /support/ask`         | Your Firecrawl API key | Your agents and apps | Full diagnostic loop scoped to your team                    |
| `POST /support/docs-search` | Your Firecrawl API key | Your agents and apps | Docs-grounded answers from Firecrawl's public documentation |

## Quick start

### Debug a failing crawl

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/support/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "my crawl returned 3 pages but I expected 50"
  }'
```

### Search the docs

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/support/docs-search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "how do I set up webhook signature verification?"
  }'
```

## How it works

When you call `/support/ask`, the AI agent:

1. **Gathers evidence** — inspects your job logs, account state, credit usage, and relevant documentation in parallel
2. **Diagnoses the issue** — reasons across all evidence to identify the root cause
3. **Proposes a fix** — generates machine-actionable `fixParameters` you can apply directly to your next API call
4. **Validates the fix** — when possible, tests the fix against the live Firecrawl API (e.g., retrying a scrape with adjusted parameters) and reports the result

## Using Ask in your agent

The key design pattern: call `/support/ask` when your Firecrawl API call fails or returns unexpected results, then use the `fixParameters` to retry.

### Python example

```python
import requests

FIRECRAWL_API_KEY = "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"

def diagnose_firecrawl_issue(question, rationale=None):
    """Call the Firecrawl Ask API to debug an issue."""
    payload = {"question": question}
    if rationale:
        payload["rationale"] = rationale

    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/support/ask",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        json=payload,
    )
    return response.json()


# Example: debug a scrape that returned empty content
result = diagnose_firecrawl_issue(
    question="scrape returned empty markdown for https://example.com",
    rationale="user needs product pricing data for competitive analysis",
)

print(result["answer"])
print(result["fixParameters"])  # e.g., {"waitFor": 5000, "actions": [...]}
print(result["confidence"])     # "high", "medium", or "low"
```

### Node.js example

```javascript
async function diagnoseFirecrawlIssue(question, rationale) {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/support/ask",
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ question, rationale }),
    }
  );
  return response.json();
}

// Example: debug a crawl that stopped early
const result = await diagnoseFirecrawlIssue(
  "my crawl returned 3 pages but I expected 50",
  "user is on their third failed crawl attempt today"
);

console.log(result.answer);
console.log(result.fixParameters);
```

### Agent retry pattern

```python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl

client = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Step 1: Try the scrape
doc = client.scrape("https://example.com/pricing", formats=["markdown"])

if not doc.markdown or len(doc.markdown) < 100:
    # Step 2: Ask for help debugging
    diagnosis = diagnose_firecrawl_issue(
        question=f"scrape returned only {len(doc.markdown or '')} chars of markdown for https://example.com/pricing",
    )

    # Step 3: Apply fix parameters and retry
    if diagnosis.get("fixParameters"):
        doc = client.scrape(
            "https://example.com/pricing",
            formats=["markdown"],
            **diagnosis["fixParameters"],
        )
```

## Parameters

### `/support/ask`

| Parameter   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `question`  | string | Yes      | What to debug (1–8,000 characters)                                                                          |
| `rationale` | string | No       | Recommended for AI callers. What the end user is trying to accomplish. Helps prioritize evidence gathering. |
| `context`   | object | No       | Free-form metadata from your agent, included in the debugging prompt                                        |

### `/support/docs-search`

| Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description                                 |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `question` | string | Yes      | The question to answer (1–8,000 characters) |

## Response

### `/support/ask` response

```json
{
  "requestId": "req_...",
  "answer": "<2-4 sentence prose diagnosis of the issue plus the recommended fix.>",
  "confidence": "high",
  "fixParameters": { "<param>": "<value>" },
  "validation": {
    "tested": true,
    "result": "success",
    "evidence": "<short summary of the validation tool call the agent ran to confirm the fix>"
  },
  "feedback": null,
  "durationMs": 18432
}
```

The actual `answer`, `fixParameters`, and `validation.evidence` are produced per request by the agent based on your specific run; the example above shows the response shape, not a real diagnosis.

### `/support/docs-search` response

```json
{
  "requestId": "req_...",
  "answer": "The signature is sent in the X-Firecrawl-Signature header...",
  "evidence": [
    { "pathOrUrl": "webhooks/security.mdx#L1-L52", "reason": "..." }
  ],
  "usage": { "inputTokens": 4356, "outputTokens": 688, "totalTokens": 5044 },
  "durationMs": 11252
}
```

## Performance

| Metric  | Typical       | Maximum                   |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Latency | 15–30 seconds | 60 seconds (hard ceiling) |
