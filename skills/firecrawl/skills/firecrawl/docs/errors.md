# Errors

> Every API error code, what causes it, how to remedy it, and whether to retry.

Every Firecrawl error response uses the same JSON shape. Look up the `error` value (or HTTP status) in the table below to find the cause, remedy, and whether the request is safe to retry.

This catalog covers the errors most agents and clients will encounter. It is non-exhaustive — if you receive an error not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/issues) so we can document it.

## Error response shape

All non-2xx responses return JSON with a top-level `success: false` and a string `error`. Some endpoints include additional fields (`details`, `code`) when more context is available.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Unauthorized: Invalid token",
  "details": "Optional structured details (only present on some errors)"
}
```

| Field     | Type      | Description                                                       |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `success` | `boolean` | Always `false` on errors.                                         |
| `error`   | `string`  | Human-readable error message. Use this to look up the row below.  |
| `details` | `any`     | Optional. Structured per-field validation errors when applicable. |

## Errors

| HTTP | `error` (typical message)                        | Cause                                                                              | Remedy                                                                                                             | Retryable         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 400  | `Bad Request` / validation message               | Request body failed schema validation (missing or invalid fields).                 | Fix the request payload using the endpoint reference. Check `details` for fields.                                  | No                |
| 400  | `Invalid URL`                                    | The `url` field is missing, malformed, or uses an unsupported scheme.              | Pass an absolute `http(s)://` URL.                                                                                 | No                |
| 401  | `Unauthorized: Invalid token`                    | API key is missing, malformed, or revoked.                                         | Send `Authorization: Bearer fc-...` with a valid key from the [dashboard](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys). | No                |
| 402  | `Payment Required: Insufficient credits`         | Plan credits are exhausted or billing is not configured.                           | Top up credits, enable auto-recharge, or upgrade your plan.                                                        | No                |
| 403  | `Forbidden`                                      | Key lacks permission for this endpoint or feature.                                 | Use a key with the required scope, or upgrade the plan that gates this feature.                                    | No                |
| 404  | `Not Found`                                      | The job ID, resource, or endpoint path does not exist.                             | Verify the resource ID and endpoint URL.                                                                           | No                |
| 408  | `Request Timeout`                                | The page took longer than the request `timeout` to load.                           | Increase `timeout`, simplify actions, or use `fastMode`.                                                           | Yes, with backoff |
| 409  | `Conflict`                                       | Resource is in a state that prevents the operation (e.g. already deleted).         | Re-fetch state and reconcile before retrying.                                                                      | No                |
| 413  | `Payload Too Large`                              | Request body exceeded the maximum allowed size.                                    | Reduce the payload (e.g. shorter schema, fewer URLs per batch).                                                    | No                |
| 422  | `Unprocessable Entity` / extraction schema error | Schema is invalid JSON Schema, or the model could not produce a conforming result. | Validate the schema; loosen required fields; try a different `model`.                                              | Sometimes         |
| 429  | `Rate limit exceeded`                            | Too many requests for your plan's per-minute limit.                                | Back off and retry after `Retry-After` seconds. See [Rate Limits](/rate-limits).                                   | Yes, with backoff |
| 429  | `Concurrency limit reached`                      | Concurrent browser limit for your plan reached.                                    | Wait for in-flight jobs to finish, lower concurrency, or upgrade your plan.                                        | Yes, with backoff |
| 500  | `Internal Server Error`                          | Unhandled server-side failure.                                                     | Retry with exponential backoff. If it persists, contact support with the request ID.                               | Yes, with backoff |
| 502  | `Bad Gateway`                                    | Upstream proxy or worker returned an invalid response.                             | Retry with backoff.                                                                                                | Yes, with backoff |
| 503  | `Service Unavailable`                            | Service temporarily unable to handle the request.                                  | Retry with backoff.                                                                                                | Yes, with backoff |
| 504  | `Gateway Timeout`                                | Request exceeded the gateway's timeout (typically long crawls).                    | Use the async crawl/batch endpoints and poll status instead.                                                       | Yes, with backoff |

For 429 responses, Firecrawl includes a `Retry-After` header (in seconds) when available — wait at least that long before retrying.

## Retry guidance

Treat the **Retryable** column as authoritative; do not infer from the HTTP status alone. The pattern below uses exponential backoff with jitter and respects `Retry-After` on 429.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import time
  import random
  import requests

  RETRYABLE_STATUSES = {408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504}

  def request_with_retry(method, url, headers=None, json=None, max_attempts=5):
      for attempt in range(max_attempts):
          resp = requests.request(method, url, headers=headers, json=json)
          if resp.status_code < 400 or resp.status_code not in RETRYABLE_STATUSES:
              return resp
          # Honor Retry-After when present, otherwise exponential backoff with jitter.
          retry_after = resp.headers.get("Retry-After")
          delay = float(retry_after) if retry_after else min(2 ** attempt, 30) + random.random()
          time.sleep(delay)
      return resp
  ```

  ```js Node
  const RETRYABLE_STATUSES = new Set([408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504]);

  async function requestWithRetry(url, init = {}, maxAttempts = 5) {
    for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++) {
      const resp = await fetch(url, init);
      if (resp.ok || !RETRYABLE_STATUSES.has(resp.status)) return resp;
      // Honor Retry-After when present, otherwise exponential backoff with jitter.
      const retryAfter = resp.headers.get('Retry-After');
      const delayMs = retryAfter
        ? Number(retryAfter) * 1000
        : Math.min(2 ** attempt, 30) * 1000 + Math.random() * 1000;
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, delayMs));
    }
  }
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  # Simple shell loop with exponential backoff for retryable statuses.
  attempt=0
  max=5
  until response=$(curl -sS -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'); do
    status=$(printf '%s' "$response" | tail -n1)
    case "$status" in
      408|429|500|502|503|504)
        attempt=$((attempt+1))
        [ "$attempt" -ge "$max" ] && break
        sleep $((2 ** attempt))
        ;;
      *) break ;;
    esac
  done
  echo "$response"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Rate limits

429 responses are the most common retryable error. Per-plan rate limits and concurrency limits are documented in [Rate Limits](/rate-limits). Always honor the `Retry-After` header when present rather than retrying immediately.
