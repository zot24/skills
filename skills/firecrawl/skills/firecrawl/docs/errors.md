# Errors

> Every API error code, what causes it, how to remedy it, and whether to retry.

Every Firecrawl error response uses the same JSON shape. Look up the `error` value (or HTTP status) in the table below to find the cause, remedy, and whether the request is safe to retry.

This catalog covers the errors most agents and clients will encounter. It is non-exhaustive — if you receive an error not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/issues) so we can document it.

## Error response shape

All non-2xx responses return JSON with a top-level `success: false` and a string `error`. Some endpoints include additional fields (`details`, `code`) when more context is available.

```json theme={null}
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Unauthorized: Invalid token",
  "details": "Optional structured details (only present on some errors)"
}
```

| Field     | Type      | Description                                                       |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `success` | `boolean` | Always `false` on errors.                                         |
| `error`   | `string`  | Human-readable error message. Use this to look up the row below.  |
| `details` | `any`     | Optional. Structured per-field validation errors when applicable. |

For 429 responses, Firecrawl includes a `Retry-After` header (in seconds) when available — wait at least that long before retrying.

## Agent

Errors specific to [`/agent`](/features/agent) and its status, trace, snapshot, and cancel endpoints. The trace and snapshot endpoints relay their upstream error body unchanged, so those two can answer with a body that omits the `success` field described above; match on the HTTP status and the `error` string.

| HTTP | `error` (typical message)                                                      | Cause                                                                      | Remedy                                                                                                                           | Retryable         |

A run that hits its `maxCredits` limit does not return an HTTP error. It finishes as a failed job. Poll the status endpoint and you get `status: "failed"` with a credit-limit error message, no `data`, and `creditsUsed: 0`, since failed runs are not billed. In the trace, the same outcome appears as a `run.finished` event with `outcome: "credit_limit_reached"`.

### Trace error codes

Terminal and `error.occurred` trace events carry a structured `error` object whose `code` is one of five values. Each also carries a `retryable` boolean, which you should treat the same way as the **Retryable** column above.

| `code`                 | Meaning and remedy                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cancelled`            | You cancelled the run. Start a new one when you want the work redone.                                                               |
| `credit_limit_reached` | The run hit its `maxCredits` ceiling. Raise `maxCredits`, or narrow the prompt so the run needs less work.                          |
| `parent_finished`      | A subagent stopped because the agent that spawned it finished first. Read the parent agent's own terminal event for the real cause. |
| `refused`              | The agent declined the task. Rephrase the prompt, or scope it to URLs you're authorized to collect from.                            |
| `internal`             | An unexpected failure inside the run. Retry the run; if it persists, contact support with the job ID.                               |

## Retry guidance

Treat the **Retryable** column as authoritative; do not infer from the HTTP status alone. The pattern below uses exponential backoff with jitter and respects `Retry-After` on 429.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import time
  import random
  import requests

  RETRYABLE_STATUSES = {408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504}

  def request_with_retry(method, url, headers=None, json=None, max_attempts=5):
      for attempt in range(max_attempts):
          resp = requests.request(method, url, headers=headers, json=json)
          if resp.status_code < 400 or resp.status_code not in RETRYABLE_STATUSES:
              return resp
          # Honor Retry-After when present, otherwise exponential backoff with jitter.
          retry_after = resp.headers.get("Retry-After")
          delay = float(retry_after) if retry_after else min(2 ** attempt, 30) + random.random()
          time.sleep(delay)
      return resp
  ```

  ```js Node
  const RETRYABLE_STATUSES = new Set([408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504]);

  async function requestWithRetry(url, init = {}, maxAttempts = 5) {
    for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++) {
      const resp = await fetch(url, init);
      if (resp.ok || !RETRYABLE_STATUSES.has(resp.status)) return resp;
      // Honor Retry-After when present, otherwise exponential backoff with jitter.
      const retryAfter = resp.headers.get('Retry-After');
      const delayMs = retryAfter
        ? Number(retryAfter) * 1000
        : Math.min(2 ** attempt, 30) * 1000 + Math.random() * 1000;
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, delayMs));
    }
  }
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  # Simple shell loop with exponential backoff for retryable statuses.
  attempt=0
  max=5
  until response=$(curl -sS -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'); do
    status=$(printf '%s' "$response" | tail -n1)
    case "$status" in
      408|429|500|502|503|504)
        attempt=$((attempt+1))
        [ "$attempt" -ge "$max" ] && break
        sleep $((2 ** attempt))
        ;;
      *) break ;;
    esac
  done
  echo "$response"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 429 responses

429 responses are the most common retryable error. Per-plan rate limits and concurrency limits are documented in [Rate Limits](/rate-limits). Always honor the `Retry-After` header when present rather than retrying immediately.
