# Run Firecrawl locally for development

> Set up the Firecrawl API development environment, verify a local scrape, and run the source-owned test harness before contributing.

Run Firecrawl locally when you are changing the API, workers, or tests. This path installs development dependencies and starts source-owned services with the API harness.


  This is a contributor development environment, not a deployment guide. If
  you want to run Firecrawl on infrastructure you control without changing the
  product, use [Self-hosting Firecrawl](/contributing/self-host).


## Choose local development or self-hosting

* **Develop locally** when you need fast code-test-debug loops against the current source revision.
* **Self-host a pinned release** when you want a stable Docker Compose baseline on your own infrastructure.
* **Use Firecrawl Cloud** when you want the fastest managed path without operating either environment.

Keep these environments separate. The API development file at `apps/api/.env` and the root Compose `.env` serve different processes and are not interchangeable.

## Start the Firecrawl development environment

### Install the prerequisites

Install:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js 22
* pnpm `11.4.0`
* [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/)
* Docker or Podman for the PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ containers managed by the API harness
* [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.23 or newer, rebuilt by the API harness on every start
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), built during `pnpm install` for the `@mendable/firecrawl-rs` native package

Enable the package manager version used by the API:

```bash theme={null}
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.4.0 --activate
```

### Clone Firecrawl and install dependencies

```bash theme={null}
git clone https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl.git
cd firecrawl/apps/api
pnpm install
```

Create `apps/api/.env` with the smallest unauthenticated development configuration:

```bash theme={null}
cat > .env <<'EOF'
PORT=3002
HOST=0.0.0.0
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_RATE_LIMIT_URL=redis://localhost:6379
USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false
PLAYWRIGHT_MICROSERVICE_URL=
EOF
```

Leave `NUQ_DATABASE_URL` and `NUQ_RABBITMQ_URL` unset when you want the harness to create local PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ containers. Set them only when you intentionally operate those dependencies yourself.

### Start Redis and Firecrawl

Start Redis in one terminal:

```bash theme={null}
redis-server
```

Then start Firecrawl from `apps/api` in another terminal:

```bash theme={null}
pnpm start
```

The start command builds the API, launches the API and worker processes, and manages the local queue containers. Keep that terminal open while you develop.

### Verify one local scrape

Check that the API process responds:

```bash theme={null}
curl \
  --fail \
  --silent \
  --show-error \
  http://localhost:3002/v0/health/readiness
```

Expected response:

```json theme={null}
{"status":"ok"}
```

Then exercise the scraping path:

```bash theme={null}
curl \
  --fail-with-body \
  --silent \
  --show-error \
  --max-time 75 \
  -X POST \
  http://localhost:3002/v2/scrape \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "formats": ["markdown"],
    "timeout": 60000
  }'
```

A successful response includes `success: true`, Markdown in `data.markdown`, and an HTTP status in `data.metadata.statusCode`.

## Change and test Firecrawl

Keep each change focused, add a successful path and relevant failure coverage, and run the narrowest source-owned test command that proves the behavior.

From `apps/api`, run the API snippet suite with its dependencies:

```bash theme={null}
pnpm harness pnpm test:snips
```

The harness starts the API, workers, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ for the test command, then cleans up the processes it started. Use a more targeted Vitest path when the full snippet suite is unnecessary.

For the contribution workflow, review the repository's [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request.

## Troubleshoot the development environment

### Redis does not connect

Confirm Redis is listening on `localhost:6379` and that both Redis URLs in `apps/api/.env` use that address.

### The harness cannot start PostgreSQL or RabbitMQ

Start Docker or Podman, then rerun `pnpm start`. If you manage the services yourself, set their connection URLs explicitly instead of relying on harness-managed containers.

### Port 3002 is already in use

Stop the other process or change `PORT` in `apps/api/.env`, then use the same port in your verification requests.

### Basic fetch works but browser rendering does not

An empty `PLAYWRIGHT_MICROSERVICE_URL` leaves the separate Playwright service disabled. Start and configure that service only when the change you are testing requires it.

## Where to go next

* **Deploying instead of developing?** Follow [Self-hosting Firecrawl](/contributing/self-host).
* **Still choosing a path?** Compare [Open source or Firecrawl Cloud](/contributing/open-source-or-cloud).
* **Ready to contribute?** Use the source-owned [contribution guide](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
