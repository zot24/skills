# Vercel Marketplace

> Install Firecrawl from the Vercel Marketplace, attach it to a project, and use the injected FIRECRAWL_API_KEY in your Vercel app.

Firecrawl is available as a native [Vercel Marketplace integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/firecrawl). Installing it provisions Firecrawl for your Vercel project and adds `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` to the project's environment variables automatically.

Use this guide when you want Firecrawl billing, API key setup, and project configuration to happen through Vercel.

## What the integration does

When you install Firecrawl from the Vercel Marketplace, Vercel connects Firecrawl to a selected project and makes the API key available as an environment variable.

* Provisions a Firecrawl account and API key through the Marketplace flow
* Adds `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` to your Vercel project environment
* Keeps Firecrawl billing on your Vercel invoice
* Lets you open Firecrawl from Vercel after the integration is connected


  If you already have a Firecrawl API key and want to configure Vercel manually, use the [Vercel Functions quickstart](/quickstarts/vercel-functions) instead.


## Install from Vercel

1. Open the [Firecrawl listing on the Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/firecrawl).
2. Click **Connect Account**.
3. Choose the Firecrawl plan you want to use.
4. Select the Vercel project that should receive the environment variable.
5. Finish the installation flow.

After installation, redeploy your project so Vercel Functions and framework server code can read the new environment variable.

## Install the SDK

In your Vercel project, install the Firecrawl Node SDK:

```bash theme={null}
npm install firecrawl
```

You do not need to paste an API key into your code. Read `process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` server-side.

## Scrape a page

Create a route handler at `app/api/scrape/route.ts`:

```typescript theme={null}
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { Firecrawl } from "firecrawl";

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
  apiKey: process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY,
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { url } = await request.json();
  const result = await firecrawl.scrape(url, {
    formats: ["markdown"],
  });

  return NextResponse.json(result);
}
```

Test the route after deployment:

```bash theme={null}
curl -X POST https://your-project.vercel.app/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.firecrawl.dev"}'
```

## Search the web

Use `search` when your app needs current web results plus page content:

```typescript theme={null}
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { Firecrawl } from "firecrawl";

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
  apiKey: process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY,
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { query } = await request.json();
  const results = await firecrawl.search(query, {
    limit: 5,
    scrapeOptions: {
      formats: ["markdown"],
    },
  });

  return NextResponse.json(results);
}
```

## Interact with dynamic pages

Use `interact` when your app needs to click, scroll, or fill forms before extracting content.

```typescript theme={null}
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { Firecrawl } from "firecrawl";

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
  apiKey: process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY,
});

export async function POST() {
  const result = await firecrawl.scrape("https://news.ycombinator.com", {
    formats: ["markdown"],
  });
  const scrapeId = result.metadata?.scrapeId;

  if (!scrapeId) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "No interactive scrape session was created" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }

  const response = await firecrawl.interact(scrapeId, {
    prompt: "Open the first story and summarize the page.",
  });

  await firecrawl.stopInteraction(scrapeId);

  return NextResponse.json({ output: response.output });
}
```


  Longer interactions can exceed short serverless timeouts. For production workflows that may take longer, run the work in a background job or use Firecrawl's async APIs with webhooks.


## Use Firecrawl with the Vercel AI SDK

If you are building an agent with the [Vercel AI SDK](/developer-guides/llm-sdks-and-frameworks/vercel-ai-sdk), install the Firecrawl AI SDK tools:

```bash theme={null}
npm install firecrawl-aisdk ai
```

Then pass Firecrawl tools to your model. The Marketplace-installed `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is read from the environment.


  The example below uses the Vercel AI Gateway model string format. Configure your AI SDK model provider or AI Gateway credentials separately.


```typescript theme={null}
import { generateText, stepCountIs } from "ai";
import { FirecrawlTools } from "firecrawl-aisdk";

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  tools: FirecrawlTools(),
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(20),
  prompt: "Search for recent Vercel AI SDK examples, scrape the best sources, and summarize them.",
});

console.log(text);
```
