# IP Restrictions

> Restrict your team's API keys to an allowlist of IP addresses or CIDR ranges, so they only work from approved networks. Enforced server-side.

IP Restrictions let your team maintain an allowlist of IP addresses and CIDR ranges that API requests must originate from. The allowlist is enforced server-side during authentication on every authenticated request, so a leaked or exfiltrated API key is useless outside your approved networks.

The allowlist is team-scoped: it applies to all of the team's API keys at once.


  IP Restrictions are an enterprise feature and are gated per organization. Contact your Firecrawl account team to have them enabled for your account.


  This is the *inbound* control — where your requests to Firecrawl may come from. If you are looking for the *outbound* direction (static egress IPs for Firecrawl's traffic to your systems, so you can allowlist Firecrawl), see [Enterprise features](/enterprise).


## What you can allowlist

Entries can be:

* **Single IPv4 addresses** — e.g. `203.0.113.7`
* **Single IPv6 addresses** — e.g. `2001:db8::1`
* **CIDR ranges**, IPv4 or IPv6 — e.g. `10.0.0.0/8`, `2001:db8::/32`

Clients connecting over IPv4-mapped IPv6 (`::ffff:203.0.113.7`) are normalized to their IPv4 form before matching, so an IPv4 entry covers them.

The allowlist is enforced only when it is **non-empty**. An empty allowlist means no restriction, so a team can never lock itself out before it has configured any IPs.

## Configuring the allowlist

Team admins manage the allowlist from [Enterprise Controls → IP Restriction](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/enterprise-controls?tab=ip-restriction) in the dashboard. Add or remove entries and save — changes take effect within about a minute.

## Enforcement

The check runs during authentication, so it covers every authenticated surface uniformly: all API versions, job status and cancellation endpoints, and websocket status connections. There is no request-level way to bypass it.

A request from an IP that is not on the allowlist is rejected with a `403`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Request blocked: IP address 198.51.100.24 is not on this team's allowed IP list. Team admins can manage allowed IPs at https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/enterprise-controls?tab=ip-restriction"
}
```

## Error reference

| Status | When                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `403`  | The request's IP address is not on the team's allowlist.                                                                       |
| `500`  | The allowlist could not be verified. Requests fail closed (are rejected) rather than bypassing the restriction. Retry shortly. |

## Notes

* IP Restrictions add no credit charges.
* IP Restrictions are independent of [Key Restrictions](/features/key-restrictions); a team can use both, and a single key can be limited by format, endpoint, and origin network at the same time.
