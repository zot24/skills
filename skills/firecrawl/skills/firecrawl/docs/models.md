# Models

> Choose the right model for your agent extraction tasks.

Firecrawl Agent runs on **Spark 2**, the default model for every run. It removes the accuracy-versus-cost decision the Spark 1 models called for: it is cheaper and faster than both of them while matching Spark 1 Pro's accuracy, and it completes a higher share of runs.

## Available Models

| Model          | Status      | Notes                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spark-2`      | **Default** | Lowest cost, fastest run time, accuracy comparable to Spark 1 Pro |
| `spark-1-pro`  | Deprecated  | Former default for complex tasks; routes to `spark-2`             |
| `spark-1-mini` | Deprecated  | Former low-cost Spark 1 option; routes to `spark-2`               |


  **Spark 1 models are deprecated.** The `spark-1-pro` and `spark-1-mini` names remain accepted for backwards compatibility, but every request — with or without the `model` parameter — executes on `spark-2`.


## Spark 2

`spark-2` is our newest agent model and powers every agent run.

**Highlights:**

* Lowest cost per run and fastest run time
* Accuracy comparable to the former Spark 1 flagship
* Handles everything from simple lookups to multi-domain research
* The only model with a reasoning budget: pass `effort` (`low`, `medium`, or `high`) to control how hard it thinks

## Spark 1 models (deprecated)

`spark-1-pro` and `spark-1-mini` are deprecated. Their names remain accepted for backwards compatibility, but requests that use them route to `spark-2` — legacy code keeps working, it just runs Spark 2. There is nothing to migrate.

## Specifying a Model

The `model` parameter is optional — every request runs `spark-2`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  app = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

  # Spark 2 is the default — every run executes on it
  result = app.agent(
      prompt="Find the pricing of Firecrawl",
      model="spark-2"
  )

  # Deprecated: Spark 1 model names are still accepted, but route to "spark-2".

  print(result.data)
  ```

  ```js Node
  import { Firecrawl } from 'firecrawl';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY" });

  // Spark 2 is the default — every run executes on it
  const result = await firecrawl.agent({
    prompt: "Find the pricing of Firecrawl",
    model: "spark-2"
  });

  // Deprecated: Spark 1 model names are still accepted, but route to "spark-2".

  console.log(result.data);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  # Spark 2 is the default — every run executes on it
  curl -X POST "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/agent" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "prompt": "Find the pricing of Firecrawl",
      "model": "spark-2"
    }'

  # Deprecated: Spark 1 model names are still accepted, but route to "spark-2".
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Pricing by Model

All models use dynamic, credit-based pricing that scales with task complexity:

* **Spark 2**: Uses substantially fewer credits than either Spark 1 model for equivalent tasks
* **Spark 1 models (deprecated)**: Requests route to Spark 2 and are billed accordingly


  Credit usage varies based on prompt complexity, data processed, and output structure — regardless of model selected.
