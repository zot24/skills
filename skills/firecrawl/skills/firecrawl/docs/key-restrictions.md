# Key Restrictions

> Lock an individual API key to specific output formats and endpoints. Enforced server-side, with no way for a request to override it.

Key Restrictions let you lock a single API key down to a defined set of output formats and endpoints. The limits are enforced server-side during authentication, so a request made with a restricted key cannot escape them by passing different flags — there is no request-level override.

This is designed for environments where a key is handed to an automated agent or an untrusted caller and you want a hard guarantee about what it can do — for example, allowing only Markdown output so a key can never be used to pull raw HTML or scripts.


  Key Restrictions are an enterprise feature and are gated per organization. Contact your Firecrawl account team to have them enabled for your account.


## What you can restrict

Each key has two independent allowlists:

* **Allowed formats** — the [output formats](/features/scrape#scrape-formats) the key may request (e.g. `markdown`). When set, the key can only request formats on the list.
* **Allowed endpoints** — the endpoint groups the key may call (e.g. `scrape`, `crawl`). When set, the key can only call endpoints in those groups.

Each list is enforced only when it is **non-empty**. An empty list means "no restriction" for that dimension, so a key with both lists empty behaves exactly like a normal key. This also means a key can never be locked out by an empty configuration.

## Configuring a key

Team admins configure restrictions from the [API Keys page](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys) in the dashboard:

1. Open the **⋯** menu on the key you want to restrict and choose **Restrictions**.
2. Select the allowed formats and/or endpoints. Selecting nothing in a section leaves that dimension unrestricted.
3. Save. A **Restricted** badge appears on the key, and changes take effect within about a minute.

Only team admins can view or change restrictions.

## Format restrictions

When a key has an allowed-formats list, every scrape-producing endpoint enforces it: `/v2/scrape`, `/v2/batch/scrape`, `/v2/crawl` (via `scrapeOptions`), and `/v2/search` (via `scrapeOptions`), plus their v1 equivalents.

A request that asks for any format not on the list is rejected:

```json theme={null}
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Request blocked: this API key is restricted to the following formats: markdown. Requested formats not allowed: rawHtml. Team admins can manage key restrictions at https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys"
}
```

### Actions that return content

Some [actions](/features/interact) return page content directly rather than through the `formats` field — `screenshot`, `scrape`, `executeJavascript`, and `pdf`. On a format-restricted key these are treated as their equivalent format:

* The `screenshot` action is allowed only if `screenshot` is on the allowed-formats list.
* `scrape`, `executeJavascript`, and `pdf` actions have no format equivalent and are always rejected on a format-restricted key.

Interaction-only actions (`wait`, `click`, `write`, `press`, `scroll`) are unaffected.

## Endpoint restrictions

When a key has an allowed-endpoints list, it may only call endpoints in those groups. Requests to any other endpoint are rejected at authentication with a `403`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Request blocked: this API key is restricted to the following endpoints: scrape. Team admins can manage key restrictions at https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys"
}
```

Available endpoint groups: `scrape`, `batch-scrape`, `crawl`, `map`, `search`, `extract`, `agent`, `parse`, `browser`, `monitor`, `research`, `llmstxt`, `deep-research`, `fireclaw`.

A few rules make the allowlist practical:

* **Job status and cancellation share their job type's group.** For example, if `crawl` is allowed, `GET /v2/crawl/{id}` (status), the crawl errors endpoint, and cancellation are all allowed too — you don't list them separately.
* **Account and metadata endpoints are always reachable** (e.g. `/v2/team/*`, `/v2/concurrency-check`), so SDK bookkeeping keeps working regardless of the allowlist.
* **Endpoints that scrape internally are gated by their own group.** `extract` and `agent` fetch pages as part of their work, so they require `extract` / `agent` on the allowlist — allowing `scrape` alone does not grant them.

## Legacy v0 API

The legacy `v0` API predates these controls, so a key with **any** restriction configured cannot use it and receives a `403`. Use the `v2` API instead.

| `403`  | A restricted key calls the legacy `v0` API.                                                                                                    |
| `500`  | The restriction configuration could not be verified. Requests fail closed (are rejected) rather than bypassing the restriction. Retry shortly. |

## Notes

* Restrictions are per key, so you can hand out a locked-down key to an agent while keeping an unrestricted key for interactive use.
* Changes propagate to the API within about a minute. There is no way to disable enforcement from within a request.
* Key Restrictions are independent of [IP Restrictions](/features/ip-restrictions); a key can have both.
