# Faster Scraping

> Speed up your scrapes by 500% with the maxAge parameter

## How It Works

Firecrawl caches previously scraped pages and, by default, returns a recent copy when available.

* **Default freshness**: `maxAge = 172800000` ms (2 days). If the cached copy is newer than this, it’s returned instantly; otherwise, Firecrawl scrapes fresh and updates the cache.
* **Force fresh**: Set `maxAge: 0` to always scrape. Be aware this bypasses the cache entirely, meaning every request goes through the full scraping pipeline, meaning that the request will take longer to complete and is more likely to fail. Use a non-zero `maxAge` if you don't need real-time content on every request.
* **Skip caching**: Set `storeInCache: false` if you don’t want to store results for a request.

Get your results **up to 500% faster** when you don’t need the absolute freshest data. Control freshness via `maxAge`:

1. **Return instantly** if we have a recent version of the page
2. **Scrape fresh** only if our version is older than your specified age
3. **Save you time** - results come back in milliseconds instead of seconds

## When to Use This

**Great for:**

* Documentation, articles, product pages
* Bulk processing jobs
* Development and testing
* Building knowledge bases

**Skip for:**

* Real-time data (stock prices, live scores, breaking news)
* Frequently updated content
* Time-sensitive applications

## Usage

Add `maxAge` to your scrape request. Values are in milliseconds (e.g., `3600000` = 1 hour).

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

  # Use cached data if it's less than 1 hour old (3600000 ms)
  # This can be 500% faster than a fresh scrape!
  scrape_result = firecrawl.scrape(
      'https://firecrawl.dev',
      formats=['markdown'],
      max_age=3600000  # 1 hour in milliseconds
  )

  print(scrape_result.markdown)
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  import Firecrawl from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY" });

  // Use cached data if it's less than 1 hour old (3600000 ms)
  // This can be 500% faster than a fresh scrape!
  const scrapeResult = await firecrawl.scrape('https://firecrawl.dev', {
    formats: ['markdown'],
    maxAge: 3600000 // 1 hour in milliseconds
  });

  console.log(scrapeResult.markdown);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Common maxAge values

Here are some helpful reference values:

* **5 minutes**: `300000` - For semi-dynamic content
* **1 hour**: `3600000` - For content that updates hourly
* **1 day**: `86400000` - For daily-updated content
* **1 week**: `604800000` - For relatively static content

## Performance impact

With `maxAge` enabled:

* **500% faster response times** for recent content
* **Instant results** instead of waiting for fresh scrapes

## Important notes

* **Default**: `maxAge` is `172800000` (2 days)
* **Fresh when needed**: If our data is older than `maxAge`, we scrape fresh automatically
* **No stale data**: You'll never get data older than your specified `maxAge`
* **Credits**: Cached results still cost 1 credit per page. Caching improves speed and latency, not credit usage.

### When caching is bypassed

Caching is automatically skipped when your request includes any of the following:

* Custom `headers`
* `actions` (browser automation steps)
* A browser `profile`
* `changeTracking` format
* Custom `screenshot` viewport or quality settings

### Cache hit matching

For a cache hit, these parameters must match exactly between the original and subsequent requests: `url`, `mobile`, `location`, `waitFor`, `blockAds`, `screenshot` (enabled/disabled and full-page), and stealth proxy mode.

You can verify cache behavior by checking `metadata.cacheState` in the response — it will be `"hit"` or `"miss"`.

## Faster crawling

The same speed benefits apply when crawling multiple pages. Use `maxAge` within `scrapeOptions` to get cached results for pages we’ve seen recently.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl
  from firecrawl.v2.types import ScrapeOptions

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

  # Crawl with cached scraping - 500% faster for pages we've seen recently
  crawl_result = firecrawl.crawl(
      'https://firecrawl.dev',
      limit=100,
      scrape_options=ScrapeOptions(
          formats=['markdown'],
          max_age=3600000  # Use cached data if less than 1 hour old
      )
  )

  for page in crawl_result.data:
      print(f"URL: {page.metadata.source_url}")
      print(f"Content: {page.markdown[:200]}...")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  import Firecrawl from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY" });

  // Crawl with cached scraping - 500% faster for pages we've seen recently
  const crawlResult = await firecrawl.crawl('https://firecrawl.dev', {
    limit: 100,
    scrapeOptions: {
      formats: ['markdown'],
      maxAge: 3600000 // Use cached data if less than 1 hour old
    }
  });

  crawlResult.data.forEach(page => {
    console.log(`URL: ${page.metadata.sourceURL}`);
    console.log(`Content: ${page.markdown.substring(0, 200)}...`);
  });
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/crawl \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://firecrawl.dev",
      "limit": 100,
      "scrapeOptions": {
        "formats": ["markdown"],
        "maxAge": 3600000
      }
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When crawling with `maxAge`, each page in your crawl will benefit from the 500% speed improvement if we have recent cached data for that page.

Start using `maxAge` today for dramatically faster scrapes and crawls!
