# MCP Web Search & Scrape in Codex CLI

> Add Firecrawl web scraping and search to OpenAI Codex CLI

Connect [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) to Firecrawl through the hosted OAuth MCP server.

## Quick setup

### 1. Add Firecrawl

```bash theme={null}
codex mcp add firecrawl --url https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp-oauth
codex mcp login firecrawl
```

The URL is a client configuration value, not a page to open directly in a browser. Codex opens the Firecrawl sign-in flow, where you choose a team and approve the connection.

### 2. Start Codex and verify

```bash theme={null}
codex
```

Enter `/mcp` and confirm that `firecrawl` is connected. If you changed an existing Firecrawl connection, start a new Codex session before retrying.

Try:

```text theme={null}
Search the web for the latest Next.js App Router release notes and summarize the sources.
```

```text theme={null}
Scrape https://docs.firecrawl.dev and list the top-level sections.
```

## Other connection modes

* [Try keyless MCP](/mcp-server/keyless#try-keyless) for Search, Scrape, and Parse without an account or key.
* [Configure an API key](/mcp-server/keyless#add-an-api-key) with `bearer_token_env_var` for unattended use. Keep the secret outside agent chat and source control.
* [Run MCP locally](/mcp-server/local) only when you need a local process or a self-hosted Firecrawl API. The local package requires Node.js 22 or newer.

## Optional: literature research

For paper and literature work, the research-index skill routes those queries to the `firecrawl_research_*` tools and the [Research Index](/features/research) instead of general web search:

```bash theme={null}
npx skills add firecrawl/skills@firecrawl-research-index
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Codex does not see the tools:** run `codex mcp list`, confirm that only one `firecrawl` entry exists, and restart Codex.
* **OAuth returns `401`:** run `codex mcp login firecrawl` and complete sign-in. A bare request to the OAuth server is expected to return `401` before authentication.
* **An API-key connection returns `401`:** replace the key in the environment that starts Codex, then start a new session.
