# Self-hosting Firecrawl

> Self-host Firecrawl with Docker Compose, verify a local scrape, understand open-source limits, and prepare the stack for production.

<span id="self-hosting-firecrawl" />

Self-host Firecrawl with Docker Compose when you need source or infrastructure control. This guide pins release `v2.11.162`, starts the API at `http://localhost:3002`, and verifies a successful `POST /v2/scrape` response with Markdown.


  This trusted-network quickstart disables API authentication and is not a
  production architecture. It starts without durable storage, TLS, high
  availability, or every Firecrawl Cloud capability.


## Choose self-hosting or Firecrawl Cloud

### Self-host Firecrawl when

* **You want control over the source or infrastructure.** This guide gets the API and its supporting services running on your machine.
* **You are comfortable operating the stack.** You will own upgrades, security, storage, monitoring, and recovery.
* **You want to validate Firecrawl against your environment.** Get the baseline working here, then design the controls in [Before production](#before-production).

Choose [Firecrawl Cloud](https://firecrawl.dev) when you want to start scraping without running infrastructure. See [Open Source vs Cloud](/contributing/open-source-or-cloud) for the capability differences.

**Our recommendation:** self-host when source access or infrastructure control is worth the operational work. If you want the fastest supported path to production, start with Firecrawl Cloud.

### What self-hosting requires

* You own upgrades, secrets, storage, monitoring, recovery, and incident response.
* Scraping still sends outbound requests to target websites. Optional proxy, parsing, or AI providers add more data flows.
* This guide keeps the first run intentionally simple. Get one scrape working, then change one decision at a time.
* The commands are pinned to `v2.11.162`. A different release may use a different Compose contract.

## Self-host Firecrawl with Docker Compose

### Start with these defaults

* **Release: Firecrawl `v2.11.162`.** Pin the code and configuration first. Upgrade after reviewing the target release's `docker-compose.yaml` and self-hosting notes.
* **API authentication: off for this local run.** Add it only with a complete supported identity and database design; one environment variable is not enough.
* **Queue: PostgreSQL.** Keep it unless you intentionally want to operate the optional FoundationDB backend.
* **Queue admin UI: off.** Enable it only with a strong `BULL_AUTH_KEY` and network controls.
* **AI and advanced scraping providers: not configured.** Add a provider when a capability you need requires it.

Keep the first run boring: get one scrape working, then add what your use case needs.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, install:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or Docker Desktop
* Docker Compose v2, invoked as `docker compose`
* `curl` for the verification requests

Make sure port `3002` is available and Docker has enough capacity to build and run several services. Firecrawl does not publish a verified minimum host size for this stack.

### Clone the verified release

This guide was verified against Firecrawl `v2.11.162`. Check out that exact release to keep the code, commands, and configuration in sync:

```bash theme={null}
git clone https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl.git
cd firecrawl
git checkout v2.11.162
```

Want to use another release? Review its `docker-compose.yaml` and self-hosting notes before reusing these values.

### Configure the evaluation deployment

Create the smallest working `.env` in the repository root:

```bash theme={null}
cat > .env <<'EOF'
USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
EOF
```

Replace the PostgreSQL password before starting the stack, and do not commit `.env`. Keep `POSTGRES_DB=postgres` for `v2.11.162` because the bundled `pg_cron` configuration targets that database. Compose passes these values to both the API and PostgreSQL service.


  `apps/api/.env.example` is for API development, not a drop-in Compose file.
  This first run disables database authentication, so requests do not need an
  API key or `Authorization` header.


Leave `NUQ_BACKEND` and `BULL_AUTH_KEY` unset. You will use the PostgreSQL queue without running the queue administration UI—fewer moving parts for the first scrape.

### Build and start Firecrawl

Build the checked-out source and start everything in the background:

```bash theme={null}
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps --all
```

Warnings about unset optional variables are expected for this baseline. `docker compose ps --all` should show the API and supporting services running, with one-shot initialization services completed. Give the stack a little time if services are still starting.

### Check API reachability

First, make sure the API can answer an HTTP request:

```bash theme={null}
curl \
  --fail \
  --silent \
  --show-error \
  --max-time 5 \
  http://localhost:3002/v0/health/readiness
```

Expected response:

```json theme={null}
{"status":"ok"}
```


  This is a heartbeat, not an end-to-end test. It does not check Redis,
  PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Playwright, workers, or outbound network access. Run the
  scrape below before treating the deployment as usable.


### Run a functional smoke test

Now test the path that matters: one real scrape. The request timeout is in milliseconds; curl's client timeout is in seconds and is slightly longer:

```bash theme={null}
curl \
  --fail-with-body \
  --silent \
  --show-error \
  --max-time 75 \
  -X POST \
  http://localhost:3002/v2/scrape \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "formats": ["markdown"],
    "timeout": 60000
  }'
```

A successful response has this shape:

```json theme={null}
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "markdown": "...",
    "metadata": {
      "statusCode": 200
    }
  }
}
```

This checks the API, scraping pipeline, one scraping-engine path, and outbound access together. Exact metadata can vary with the target response.

If you get these success fields, Firecrawl is working end to end on your infrastructure. Keep this baseline, then choose what to add next.

## Self-hosted feature support

Your first scrape works. Add the next capability because you need it, not because it exists:

| If you need                                                                                | Decision                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core scrape, crawl, map, and search routes                                                 | Keep the default stack. Fetch and Playwright processing are included.                                      |
| LLM-backed extraction or formats                                                           | Connect an OpenAI-compatible provider or Ollama, then test that path separately.                           |
| Fire-engine or its advanced anti-bot behavior                                              | Run and configure that service separately; it is not included.                                             |
| Screenshots or page actions                                                                | Not available in the default stack. Fetch and Playwright both report no support; both require Fire-engine. |
| Agent, Browser, interact, feedback, or specialized product, menu, audio, and video formats | Use Firecrawl Cloud, or verify the external service requirements for the specific capability.              |

For the broader product comparison, see [Open Source vs Cloud](/contributing/open-source-or-cloud). For release-specific configuration, use the pinned [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/blob/v2.11.162/docker-compose.yaml) as the companion source.

## Before production

Compose gets you to first success. Production needs a few explicit choices before the API leaves a trusted network:

* **If data must survive service replacement,** add durable storage for PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ, then define and test backup and restore procedures. The provided Compose file does not add those volumes.
* **If users or untrusted networks can reach the API,** add a supported authentication design, network access controls, and TLS at a reverse proxy or ingress. Do not expose this unauthenticated baseline publicly.
* **If you have availability or capacity requirements,** set uptime targets, monitoring, resource sizing, scaling triggers, and upgrade and rollback procedures. The Compose limits are not verified minimum requirements.
* **If data location or compliance matters,** map requests to target websites and every optional AI, proxy, or parsing provider before enabling them.
* **If secrets must be managed centrally,** move the database password out of `.env` and into your platform's secret-management system.

These are infrastructure decisions. No single `.env` switch makes the stack production-ready.

## Where to go next

* **Still evaluating?** Keep the API on a trusted network and run `docker compose down` when you are finished.
* **Adding an open-source capability?** Use [Self-hosted feature support](#self-hosted-feature-support) to find the required provider or service, then test that path on its own.
* **Changing Firecrawl code?** Switch to [Running Locally](/contributing/guide) for the contributor development environment.
* **Connecting a client?** Point the [Firecrawl CLI](/sdks/cli#connect-the-cli-to-self-hosted-firecrawl) or [local MCP server](/mcp-server/local#connect-mcp-to-self-hosted-firecrawl) at your verified API URL.
* **Moving to Kubernetes?** Start with the versioned Kubernetes or Helm references linked from [`SELF_HOST.md`](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/blob/main/SELF_HOST.md), then make the production decisions above explicit for your platform.
* **Want managed infrastructure or Cloud-only capabilities?** Compare [Open Source vs Cloud](/contributing/open-source-or-cloud).
* **Going to production?** Complete every decision in [Before production](#before-production) before exposing the API.

## Troubleshooting

### You're bypassing authentication

If you see this warning with `USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false`, you are on the expected first-run path. Requests use a self-hosted identity and need no API key. If the API is reachable from an untrusted network, stop and add the controls in [Before production](#before-production).

### Docker containers fail to start

If any long-running service exits, inspect container state and recent logs:

```bash theme={null}
docker compose ps --all
docker compose logs --tail=200
```

* If the source revision differs, either check out `v2.11.162` or use that release's configuration.
* If a build or container is resource-constrained, increase Docker CPU, memory, or disk capacity.
* If PostgreSQL fails, check `.env` syntax, keep `POSTGRES_DB=postgres`, and make sure the user and password values are consistent.

### Connection issues with Redis

If a container cannot connect to Redis, keep the Compose service address `redis://redis:6379`. `localhost` points back to that container, not the Redis service.

```bash theme={null}
docker compose ps redis
docker compose logs --tail=100 redis
```

If you added `REDIS_URL` or `REDIS_RATE_LIMIT_URL`, remove the override to restore the default or use an address that resolves from inside the Compose network.

### API endpoint does not respond

If port `3002` does not respond, check the API container and its logs:

```bash theme={null}
docker compose ps api
docker compose logs --tail=200 api
```

If another process owns port `3002`, stop it or change the published port consistently. During initial startup, retry only after the API container reports as running.

If `/v0/health/readiness` succeeds but `/v2/scrape` fails, inspect the API and Playwright logs because the reachability endpoint does not validate those dependencies:

```bash theme={null}
docker compose logs --tail=200 api playwright-service
```

### Scrape request times out

If the scrape times out, confirm the deployment can reach `https://example.com` and that the API and Playwright services are running. Keep curl's `--max-time` longer than the request body's `timeout` so the API can return its own timeout response.
