# Ask

The `/support/ask` endpoint is an AI support agent that diagnoses issues with your Firecrawl jobs, account, and API usage. Send a question and receive a verified answer with actionable fix parameters — typically in 15–30 seconds.

## Designed for AI agents

`/support/ask` is built for **agent-to-agent** communication. If you're building an AI agent that uses Firecrawl, wire this endpoint into your error-handling flow so your agent can self-diagnose scraping failures, crawl issues, and configuration problems without human intervention.

Pass a `rationale` field to give the support agent context about what your end user is trying to accomplish. This helps prioritize the evidence gathering.

## How it works

1. **You describe the problem** — a natural-language question describing the issue.
2. **The agent investigates** — it inspects job logs, account state, documentation, and source code.
3. **The agent validates** — when possible, the agent tests a fix against the live Firecrawl API (e.g., retrying a scrape with adjusted parameters).
4. **You get a verified answer** — the response includes a prose `answer`, machine-readable `fixParameters` you can apply directly, and `validation` results showing whether the fix was tested.

## Authentication

Uses your Firecrawl API key as the bearer token. The request is automatically scoped to your team — you can only query your own jobs and account data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/support/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "my crawl returned 3 pages but I expected 50",
    "rationale": "user is on their third failed crawl attempt today"
  }'
```

## Response fields

| Field           | Type           | Description                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `answer`        | string         | 2-4 sentence prose covering the diagnosis and fix                                    |
| `confidence`    | string         | `high`, `medium`, or `low`                                                           |
| `fixParameters` | object \| null | API parameters to apply the fix (e.g., `{"waitFor": 5000}`)                          |
| `validation`    | object \| null | Whether the fix was tested: `tested`, `result` (success/failure/skipped), `evidence` |
| `feedback`      | object \| null | Present when the agent gets stuck; `{ blockedBy, attempted }`. Null on success.      |
| `durationMs`    | integer        | Total execution time in milliseconds                                                 |

## Status codes

| Code  | Meaning                                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | Answered or stuck (envelope always returned)    |
| `400` | Invalid JSON or schema violation                |
| `401` | Missing or invalid bearer token                 |
| `504` | Hit 60s hard budget — partial envelope returned |
