# MCP Web Search & Scrape in Gemini CLI

> Add Firecrawl web scraping and search to Google Gemini CLI

Add Firecrawl's search, scrape, crawl, and browser tools to [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) via MCP.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get Your API Key

Sign up at [firecrawl.dev/app](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app) and copy your API key.

### 2. Add Firecrawl to Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI reads MCP config from `~/.gemini/settings.json` (global) or `.gemini/settings.json` in your project. Add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "fc-YOUR-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `fc-YOUR-API-KEY` with your Firecrawl API key.

### 3. Launch Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini
```

Confirm the server is loaded:

```
/mcp list
```

You should see `firecrawl` and its tools.

## Quick Demo

```
Use firecrawl to search the web for "Gemini 2.5 context window" and summarize the top 5 results.
```

```
Scrape https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs and outline the sections.
```

```
Crawl https://example.com and extract the product names from /products.
```

## Remote Hosted URL (no Node.js required)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "url": "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/fc-YOUR-API-KEY/v2/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Tools don't show up** — restart Gemini CLI after editing `settings.json`; MCP servers are loaded at startup.
* **`spawn npx ENOENT`** — install Node.js 18+ or use the remote hosted URL.
* **Rate-limited** — upgrade your Firecrawl plan at [firecrawl.dev/pricing](https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing).
