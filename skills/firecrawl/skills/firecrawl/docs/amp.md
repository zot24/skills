# MCP Web Search & Scrape in Amp

> Add Firecrawl web scraping and search to Sourcegraph Amp

Add Firecrawl's keyless Search, Scrape, and Parse tools to [Sourcegraph Amp](https://ampcode.com) through the hosted MCP server.

## Quick setup

Open Amp settings and add this remote MCP server:

```json theme={null}
{
  "amp.mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "url": "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Reload Amp and confirm that `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, and `firecrawl_parse` are available.

Keyless access has limits shared by users on the same public IP. Sign in from an interactive client with [For Humans](/mcp-server/oauth), or [add an API key](/mcp-server/keyless#add-an-api-key) for unattended use.

## Try it

```text theme={null}
Search the web for "Sourcegraph Cody vs Amp" and summarize the sources.
```

```text theme={null}
Scrape https://docs.firecrawl.dev and list the core endpoints.
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Server does not connect:** confirm the URL is exactly `https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp` and inspect Amp's MCP logs.
* **Crawl or another tool is missing:** keyless exposes exactly Search, Scrape, and Parse. Connect with OAuth or an API key for the broader tool surface.
