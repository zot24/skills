# Observability & Monitoring

> Monitor websites, track uptime, and detect changes in real-time

DevOps and SRE teams use Firecrawl to monitor websites, track availability, and detect critical changes across their digital infrastructure.

## Start with a Template


  Real-time website monitoring and intelligent change detection


## How It Works

Call Firecrawl's scrape or extract API on a schedule to capture page content, then compare each snapshot against a baseline in your own system. When the extracted data changes or a page fails to load, trigger an alert through your existing tools (PagerDuty, Slack, email, etc.).

Because Firecrawl fully renders JavaScript before extracting, you get the page as users see it, not just the raw HTML. This makes it reliable for monitoring SPAs, dynamic dashboards, and client-rendered content.

## What You Can Monitor

* **Availability**: Uptime, response times, error rates
* **Content**: Text changes, image updates, layout shifts
* **Performance**: Page load times, resource sizes, Core Web Vitals
* **Security**: SSL certificates, security headers, misconfigurations
* **SEO Health**: Meta tags, structured data, sitemap validity
* **User journeys**: Multi-step transaction flows and cross-browser rendering

## FAQs


    Firecrawl extracts website content and structure on demand. Build monitoring systems that call Firecrawl's API to check pages, compare extracted data against baselines, and trigger your own alerts when changes occur.


    Yes! Firecrawl fully renders JavaScript, making it perfect for monitoring modern SPAs, React apps, and dynamic content. We capture the page as users see it, not just the raw HTML.


    Firecrawl extracts data in real-time when called. Build your monitoring system to check sites at whatever frequency you need - from minute-by-minute for critical pages to daily for routine checks.


    Yes. Use the extract API to pull specific elements like prices, inventory levels, or critical content. Build validation logic in your monitoring system to verify that important information is present and correct.


    Firecrawl provides webhooks that you can use to build integrations with your alerting tools. Send extracted data to PagerDuty, Slack, email, or any monitoring platform by building connectors that process Firecrawl's responses.
