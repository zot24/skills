# Search

> Search the web and get full content from results

Search the web and get clean, structured content from every result in a single API call. Pass a query to `/search` and Firecrawl returns titles, descriptions, and URLs. Add `scrapeOptions` to also retrieve full-page markdown, HTML, links, or screenshots for each result.

For the full parameter list, see the [Search Endpoint API Reference](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/search).


  Test searching in the interactive playground — no code required.


## Performing a Search with Firecrawl

### /search endpoint

Used to perform web searches and optionally retrieve content from the results.

### Installation

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # pip install firecrawl-py

  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(
    # No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    # api_key="fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  )
  ```

  ```js Node
  // npm install firecrawl

  import { Firecrawl } from 'firecrawl';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
    // No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    // apiKey: "fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  });
  ```

  ```bash CLI
  # Install globally with npm
  npm install -g firecrawl

  # Authenticate (one-time setup)
  firecrawl login
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Basic Usage

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(
    # No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    # api_key="fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  )

  results = firecrawl.search(
      query="firecrawl",
      limit=3,
  )
  print(results)
  ```

  ```js Node
  import { Firecrawl } from 'firecrawl';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
    // No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    // apiKey: "fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  });

  const results = await firecrawl.search('firecrawl', {
    limit: 3,
    scrapeOptions: { formats: ['markdown'] }
  });
  console.log(results);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  # No API key needed to get started — add -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" for higher rate limits:
  curl -s -X POST "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "query": "firecrawl",
      "limit": 3
    }'
  ```

  ```bash CLI
  # Search the web
  firecrawl search "firecrawl web scraping" --limit 5 --pretty
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Response

SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the complete payload.

      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```


  **SDK users:** search results are grouped by source type, not under a generic `.data` array. Access web results with `result.web`, news with `result.news`, and images with `result.images`.

  ```python Python
  result = firecrawl.search("query")
  for item in result.web or []:
      print(item.url, item.title)
  ```

  ```js JavaScript
  const result = await firecrawl.search("query");
  for (const item of result.web ?? []) {
    console.log(item.url, item.title);
  }
  ```


## Search result types

In addition to regular web results, Search supports specialized result types via the `sources` parameter:

* `web`: standard web results (default)
* `news`: news-focused results
* `images`: image search results

You can request multiple sources in a single call (e.g., `sources: ["web", "news"]`). When you do, the `limit` parameter applies **per source type** — so `limit: 5` with `sources: ["web", "news"]` returns up to 5 web results and up to 5 news results (10 total). If you need different parameters per source (for example, different `limit` values or different `scrapeOptions`), make separate calls instead.

## Search Categories

Filter search results by specific categories using the `categories` parameter:

* `github`: Search within GitHub repositories, code, issues, and documentation
* `research`: Search academic and research websites (arXiv, Nature, IEEE, PubMed, etc.)
* `pdf`: Search for PDFs

### GitHub Category Search

Search specifically within GitHub repositories:

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "web scraping python",
    "categories": ["github"],
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Research Category Search

Search academic and research websites:

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "machine learning transformers",
    "categories": ["research"],
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Mixed Category Search

Combine multiple categories in one search:

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "neural networks",
    "categories": ["github", "research"],
    "limit": 15
  }'
```

## Domain Filters

Use `includeDomains` to restrict search results to specific domains, or `excludeDomains` to remove specific domains from the search. These fields add `site:` and `-site:` operators to the query internally, so pass domains only without a protocol or path.


  `includeDomains` and `excludeDomains` are mutually exclusive. Use one or the other in a single request.


### Include Domains

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "web scraping",
    "includeDomains": ["firecrawl.dev", "docs.firecrawl.dev"],
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Exclude Domains

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "web scraping tools",
    "excludeDomains": ["example.com"],
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Category Response Format

Each search result includes a `category` field indicating its source:

```json theme={null}
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "web": [
      {
        "url": "https://github.com/example/neural-network",
        "title": "Neural Network Implementation",
        "description": "A PyTorch implementation of neural networks",
        "category": "github"
      },
      {
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2024.12345",
        "title": "Advances in Neural Network Architecture",
        "description": "Research paper on neural network improvements",
        "category": "research"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Examples:

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "openai",
    "sources": ["news"],
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "jupiter",
    "sources": ["images"],
    "limit": 8
  }'
```

### HD Image Search with Size Filtering

Use images operators to find high-resolution images:

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "sunset imagesize:1920x1080",
    "sources": ["images"],
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mountain wallpaper larger:2560x1440",
    "sources": ["images"],
    "limit": 8
  }'
```

**Common HD resolutions:**

* `imagesize:1920x1080` - Full HD (1080p)
* `imagesize:2560x1440` - QHD (1440p)
* `imagesize:3840x2160` - 4K UHD
* `larger:1920x1080` - HD and above
* `larger:2560x1440` - QHD and above

## Search with Content Scraping

Search and retrieve content from the search results in one operation.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(
    # No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    # api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY",
  )

  # Search and scrape content
  results = firecrawl.search(
      "firecrawl web scraping",
      limit=3,
      scrape_options={
          "formats": ["markdown", "links"]
      }
  )
  ```

  ```js Node
  import { Firecrawl } from 'firecrawl';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
    // No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    // apiKey: "fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  });

  const results = await firecrawl.search('firecrawl', {
    limit: 3,
    scrapeOptions: { formats: ['markdown'] }
  });
  console.log(results);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  # No API key needed to get started — add -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" for higher rate limits:
  curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "query": "firecrawl web scraping",
      "limit": 3,
      "scrapeOptions": {
        "formats": ["markdown", "links"]
      }
    }'
  ```

  ```bash CLI
  # Search and scrape results
  firecrawl search "firecrawl" --scrape --scrape-formats markdown --limit 5 --pretty
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Every option in scrape endpoint is supported by this search endpoint through the `scrapeOptions` parameter.

### Response with Scraped Content

```json theme={null}
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "title": "Firecrawl - The Ultimate Web Scraping API",
      "description": "Firecrawl is a powerful web scraping API that turns any website into clean, structured data for AI and analysis.",
      "url": "https://firecrawl.dev/",
      "markdown": "# Firecrawl\n\nThe Ultimate Web Scraping API\n\n## Turn any website into clean, structured data\n\nFirecrawl makes it easy to extract data from websites for AI applications, market research, content aggregation, and more...",
      "links": [
        "https://firecrawl.dev/pricing",
        "https://firecrawl.dev/docs",
        "https://firecrawl.dev/guides"
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Firecrawl - The Ultimate Web Scraping API",
        "description": "Firecrawl is a powerful web scraping API that turns any website into clean, structured data for AI and analysis.",
        "sourceURL": "https://firecrawl.dev/",
        "statusCode": 200
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Search then Scrape (Two-Step Pattern)

If you need to filter or process search results before scraping, use a two-step approach: search first, then scrape the URLs you want.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

  # Step 1: Search
  results = firecrawl.search("firecrawl web scraping", limit=5)

  # Step 2: Scrape each result URL for full content
  for item in results.web or []:
      page = firecrawl.scrape(item.url, formats=["markdown"])
      print(page.markdown[:200])
  ```

  ```js JavaScript
  import Firecrawl from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY" });

  // Step 1: Search
  const results = await firecrawl.search("firecrawl web scraping", { limit: 5 });

  // Step 2: Scrape each result URL for full content
  for (const item of results.web ?? []) {
    const page = await firecrawl.scrape(item.url, { formats: ["markdown"] });
    console.log(page.markdown?.substring(0, 200));
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>


  **When to use which approach:**

  * **One-step** (`scrapeOptions` in search): You want content from all results. Simpler and faster.
  * **Two-step** (search then scrape): You want to filter, rank, or selectively scrape results. More flexible.

  Both approaches use Firecrawl for the scrape step. Do not use generic HTTP fetching or summarize from search snippets alone -- the full page content from Firecrawl scrape is what makes results grounded and complete.


## Advanced Search Options

Firecrawl's search API supports various parameters to customize your search:

### Location Customization

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(
    # No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    # api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY",
  )

  # Search with location settings (Germany)
  search_result = firecrawl.search(
      "web scraping tools",
      limit=5,
      location="Germany"
  )

  # Process the results
  for result in search_result.data:
      print(f"Title: {result['title']}")
      print(f"URL: {result['url']}")
  ```

  ```js Node
  import { Firecrawl } from 'firecrawl';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
    // No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    // apiKey: "fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  });

  // Search with location settings (Germany)
  const results = await firecrawl.search('web scraping tools', {
    limit: 5,
    location: "Germany"
  });

  // Process the results
  console.log(results);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  # No API key needed to get started — add -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" for higher rate limits:
  curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "query": "web scraping tools",
      "limit": 5,
      "location": "Germany"
    }'
  ```

  ```bash CLI
  # Search with location
  firecrawl search "local restaurants" --location "San Francisco,California,United States" --country US --pretty
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Time-Based Search

Use the `tbs` parameter to filter results by time. Note that `tbs` only applies to `web` source results — it does not filter `news` or `images` results. If you need time-filtered news, consider using a `web` source with the `site:` operator to target specific news domains.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(
    # No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    # api_key="fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  )

  results = firecrawl.search(
      query="firecrawl",
      limit=5,
      tbs="qdr:d",
  )
  print(len(results.get('web', [])))
  ```

  ```js Node
  import { Firecrawl } from 'firecrawl';

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({
    // No API key needed to get started — add one for higher rate limits:
    // apiKey: "fc-YOUR-API-KEY",
  });

  const results = await firecrawl.search('firecrawl', {
    limit: 5,
    tbs: 'qdr:d', // past day
  });

  console.log(results.web);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  # No API key needed to get started — add -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" for higher rate limits:
  curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "query": "latest web scraping techniques",
      "limit": 5,
      "tbs": "qdr:w"
    }'
  ```

  ```bash CLI
  # Search with time filter (past week)
  firecrawl search "firecrawl updates" --tbs qdr:w --limit 5 --pretty
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Common `tbs` values:

* `qdr:h` - Past hour
* `qdr:d` - Past 24 hours
* `qdr:w` - Past week
* `qdr:m` - Past month
* `qdr:y` - Past year
* `sbd:1` - Sort by date (newest first)

For more precise time filtering, you can specify exact date ranges using the custom date range format:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  # Initialize the client with your API key
  firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

  # Search for results from December 2024
  search_result = firecrawl.search(
      "firecrawl updates",
      limit=10,
      tbs="cdr:1,cd_min:12/1/2024,cd_max:12/31/2024"
  )
  ```

  ```js JavaScript
  import { Firecrawl } from 'firecrawl';

  // Initialize the client with your API key
  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"});

  // Search for results from December 2024
  firecrawl.search("firecrawl updates", {
    limit: 10,
    tbs: "cdr:1,cd_min:12/1/2024,cd_max:12/31/2024"
  })
  .then(searchResult => {
    console.log(searchResult.data);
  });
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "query": "firecrawl updates",
      "limit": 10,
      "tbs": "cdr:1,cd_min:12/1/2024,cd_max:12/31/2024"
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You can combine `sbd:1` with time filters to get date-sorted results within a time range. For example, `sbd:1,qdr:w` returns results from the past week sorted newest first, and `sbd:1,cdr:1,cd_min:12/1/2024,cd_max:12/31/2024` returns results from December 2024 sorted by date.

### Custom Timeout

Set a custom timeout for search operations:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  # Initialize the client with your API key
  firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

  # Set a 30-second timeout
  search_result = firecrawl.search(
      "complex search query",
      limit=10,
      timeout=30000  # 30 seconds in milliseconds
  )
  ```

  ```js JavaScript
  import { Firecrawl } from 'firecrawl';

  // Initialize the client with your API key
  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"});

  // Set a 30-second timeout
  firecrawl.search("complex search query", {
    limit: 10,
    timeout: 30000  // 30 seconds in milliseconds
  })
  .then(searchResult => {
    // Process results
    console.log(searchResult.data);
  });
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "query": "complex search query",
      "limit": 10,
      "timeout": 30000
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Zero Data Retention (ZDR)

For teams with strict data handling requirements, Firecrawl offers Zero Data Retention (ZDR) options for the `/search` endpoint via the `enterprise` parameter. ZDR search is available on Enterprise plans — visit [firecrawl.dev/enterprise](https://www.firecrawl.dev/enterprise) to get started.


  This is separate from the `zeroDataRetention` scrape option, which controls ZDR for scraping operations. See [Scrape ZDR](/features/scrape#zero-data-retention-zdr) for details. The `enterprise` parameter only applies to the search portion of the request.


### End-to-End ZDR

With end-to-end ZDR, both Firecrawl and our upstream search provider enforce zero data retention. No query or result data is stored at any point in the pipeline.

* **Cost:** 10 credits per 10 results
* **Parameter:** `enterprise: ["zdr"]`

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "sensitive topic",
    "limit": 10,
    "enterprise": ["zdr"]
  }'
```

### Anonymized ZDR

With anonymized ZDR, Firecrawl enforces full zero data retention on our side. Our search provider may cache the query, but it is fully anonymized — no identifying information is attached.

* **Cost:** 2 credits per 10 results
* **Parameter:** `enterprise: ["anon"]`

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "sensitive topic",
    "limit": 10,
    "enterprise": ["anon"]
  }'
```

### Combining Search ZDR with Scrape ZDR

If you are using search with content scraping (`scrapeOptions`), the `enterprise` parameter covers the search portion while `zeroDataRetention` in `scrapeOptions` covers the scraping portion. To get full ZDR across both, set both:

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "sensitive topic",
    "limit": 5,
    "enterprise": ["zdr"],
    "scrapeOptions": {
      "formats": ["markdown"],
      "zeroDataRetention": true
    }
  }'
```

## Cost Implications

The cost of a search is 2 credits per 10 results, rounded up (1–10 results = 2 credits, 11–20 = 4 credits, and so on). If scraping options are enabled, the standard scraping costs apply to each search result:

* **Basic scrape**: 1 credit per webpage
* **PDF parsing**: 1 credit per PDF page
* **Enhanced proxy mode**: 4 additional credits per webpage
* **JSON mode**: 4 additional credits per webpage

To help control costs:

* Set `parsers: []` if PDF parsing isn’t required
* Use `proxy: "basic"` instead of `"enhanced"` when possible, or set it to `"auto"`
* Limit the number of search results with the `limit` parameter

## Advanced Scraping Options

For more details about the scraping options, refer to the [Scrape Feature documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/scrape). Everything except for the FIRE-1 Agent and Change-Tracking features are supported by this Search endpoint.

## Search feedback

When a search result is useful or misses important content, submit feedback with `POST /v2/search/{jobId}/feedback`. The first feedback submission for a search job can refund 1 credit, subject to team limits, and helps improve Firecrawl search quality. See [Search Feedback](/api-reference/endpoint/search-feedback).
