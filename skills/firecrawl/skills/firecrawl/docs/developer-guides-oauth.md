# Connect MCP Clients with OAuth

> Authenticate MCP clients with Firecrawl using OAuth instead of embedding your API key in the URL

Most MCP setup guides connect by putting your API key directly in the server URL (`https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/YOUR_API_KEY/v2/mcp`). If your MCP client supports OAuth, you can instead connect to the keyless endpoint and sign in through your browser. Firecrawl mints a short-lived, scoped token for the client, so your raw API key is never copied into the client's configuration.


  OAuth support is automatic for clients that implement the MCP authorization spec (for example Claude.ai's custom connectors). There is nothing to enable on your Firecrawl account first.


## Why use OAuth

* **No API key in the URL.** The client never stores your raw `fc-` key. It holds a short-lived access token instead.
* **Short-lived, rotating tokens.** Access tokens expire after 1 hour; refresh tokens rotate on every use.
* **Scoped and per-client.** Each connected client gets its own token, so access can be reasoned about and revoked independently.
* **Reduced blast radius.** A leaked client token is scoped and short-lived, not your full account key.

## Connect

### 1. Use the keyless MCP URL

Point your MCP client at the base endpoint, with no API key in the path:

```
https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp
```

If your client asks for an **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret**, leave both blank. Firecrawl uses [Dynamic Client Registration](#supported-standards), so the client registers itself automatically.

### 2. Sign in and authorize

When the client first connects, it opens a Firecrawl page in your browser. Sign in to your Firecrawl account if you are not already, then review the consent screen:

> **Authorize \<client name>**
> This application wants full access to the Firecrawl API using your Firecrawl account.

Click **Allow**. The client receives its token and the connection completes. All requests the client makes are billed to and act on behalf of your Firecrawl account.


  If your client lets you pick the team or account before authorizing, make sure you sign in to the account whose credits you want the connector to use. You can review usage anytime at [firecrawl.dev/app/usage](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/usage).


### Which account the connector uses

The token is minted for the Firecrawl account you sign in with during the consent step, and every request the connector makes counts against that account's credits. If you belong to multiple teams, switch to the team you want before approving (use the team selector at the top left of the [Firecrawl dashboard](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app)). To connect a different account later, disconnect the connector in your client and reconnect, signing in with the account you want.

## Connect from other clients

Any client that implements the MCP authorization spec can use the keyless endpoint by pointing at `https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp` and completing the browser sign-in when prompted.


  **Client redirect-URI support.** Firecrawl's authorization server accepts OAuth redirect URIs that are **HTTPS** or **loopback** (`http://localhost` / `http://127.0.0.1`). Some clients (for example **Cursor** and **VS Code**) register a custom URL scheme such as `cursor://` as their redirect, which is not currently accepted, so connecting them directly to the keyless URL fails before the browser opens. With those clients, use the [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) wrapper (it uses a loopback redirect) or the [API-key URL](#oauth-vs-api-key-in-the-url) instead.


The `mcp-remote` wrapper works with any client that runs a local command, including Cursor and VS Code. It performs the OAuth flow over a loopback redirect and opens your browser to authorize:

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For clients that only support an API key, use the API-key-in-URL form (`https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/YOUR_API_KEY/v2/mcp`) instead.

## OAuth vs. API key in the URL

Both methods work and use the same MCP tools. Choose based on your client:

|                            | API key in URL                                  | OAuth                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **URL**                    | `https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/YOUR_API_KEY/v2/mcp` | `https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp`                |
| **Setup**                  | Paste API key into the URL                      | Sign in via browser, click Allow                  |
| **What the client stores** | Your raw API key                                | A short-lived, scoped token                       |
| **Best for**               | Clients without OAuth support                   | Clients that implement MCP OAuth (e.g. Claude.ai) |

## Supported standards

Firecrawl runs a standards-compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization server, so any MCP client that follows the [MCP authorization spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification) can connect without custom code:

* **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + PKCE** (S256 only)
* **RFC 8414** — Authorization Server Metadata discovery
* **RFC 9728** — Protected Resource Metadata (the MCP server returns a `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header pointing clients to discovery)
* **RFC 7591** — Dynamic Client Registration
* **RFC 8707** — Resource Indicators

Clients discover everything they need from the metadata document:

```bash theme={null}
curl -s "https://www.firecrawl.dev/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server" | jq .
```


  When requesting a token for the MCP server, spec-compliant clients pass `resource=https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp` on the `/authorize` and `/token` calls (per RFC 8707). Most MCP clients handle this for you automatically by reading the metadata above.
