# Verifying Freshness and Liveness

> Understand the difference between content freshness and whether the state represented by a page is current

A successful scrape tells you what the page returned. It does not prove that the **state represented by the page** is current. These are two separate questions.

* **Freshness** → Is this content recent, or a copy reused from Firecrawl's cache? Controlled by `maxAge`.
* **Liveness** → Is the underlying thing still real and active? Your application decides this from the available evidence.

This guide explains the difference, walks through the `maxAge` tradeoff, and gives a checklist and worked example for freshness-sensitive actions.

## Quick Comparison

|                                          | Freshness                                                                     | Liveness                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Question**                             | Is this content recent, or reused from cache?                                 | Is the object the page describes still active?                                  |
| **You control it with**                  | The `maxAge` request parameter                                                | Your own domain logic                                                           |
| **Firecrawl reports**                    | `metadata.cacheState` (`"hit"` or `"miss"`), and `metadata.cachedAt` on a hit | Nothing directly — only page evidence                                           |
| **Evidence you get**                     | Whether the response came from cache                                          | Page content, `metadata.statusCode`, and `metadata.url` vs `metadata.sourceURL` |
| **Settled by an HTTP 200 with content?** | **No** — a 200 says nothing about how recent the content is                   | **No** — a 200 only describes the page response                                 |

## The Freshness Tradeoff (`maxAge`)

Firecrawl caches previously scraped pages and returns a recent copy when one is available, which cuts latency. `maxAge` is the maximum age, in milliseconds, of a cached copy that Firecrawl may return instead of retrieving the page again.

* **Omit `maxAge`**: Firecrawl may return recently cached content. The default window is 2 days; Firecrawl may use a different window for some sites.
* **Set `maxAge: 0`**: Firecrawl skips the cache for that request and retrieves the page. This trades latency and reliability for a fresher retrieval.

Keep caching on by default. Pay the `maxAge: 0` latency cost only for the reads where staleness would cause a wrong or costly decision — it does not change what the page costs you in credits.

`metadata.cacheState` is returned when Firecrawl considered its cache for the request, so it is a useful check while you tune `maxAge`. It is not part of a `maxAge: 0` response, because that request skips the cache altogether.

For caching mechanics, common `maxAge` values, cache-hit matching rules, and the request options that bypass caching automatically, see [Faster Scraping](/features/fast-scraping).

### Where `maxAge` Applies

| Endpoint                  | Behavior                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/scrape`                 | `maxAge` is honored on the request body                                                                                                |
| `/crawl`, `/batch/scrape` | `maxAge` is honored inside `scrapeOptions`                                                                                             |
| `/search`                 | Search applies its own freshness window to the pages it scrapes, so `maxAge` in `scrapeOptions` does not take effect                   |
| `/parse`                  | `/parse` always processes the file you supply and never serves or stores cached content, so `maxAge` and `storeInCache` have no effect |

If you need a fresh retrieval of a page you found through `/search`, scrape that URL again with `/scrape` and `maxAge: 0`.

## Freshness Is Not Liveness

Even with `maxAge: 0`, the result only tells you what the page returned on that retrieval. A page can return HTTP 200 with content while representing an outdated, unavailable, or otherwise changed state.

So neither the status code nor the presence of content settles liveness. Liveness is a conclusion your application draws from source-specific evidence.

***

## Freshness-Sensitive Action Checklist

Before an action that depends on current state, treat scrape output as **evidence, not proof**:

1. **Use `maxAge: 0` for the final retrieval** so the response is not served from cache.
2. **Do not treat HTTP 200 or non-empty content as proof of liveness.**
3. **Inspect rendered content and redirect evidence.** `metadata.sourceURL` is the URL you requested; `metadata.url` is the URL the engine reports for the response. When the two differ, it can indicate a redirect to a different resource. Matching values do not prove that no redirect occurred.
4. **Prefer source-specific APIs or identifiers** where available — they often expose an explicit status that a rendered page hides.
5. **Treat inconclusive evidence as `unknown`**, and stop before the expensive or irreversible step, rather than assuming active.

## Worked Example: Collect Current Page Evidence

Skip the cache, then collect the rendered content and response metadata for your application's own validation rules. The scrape supplies evidence; it does not decide the domain-specific state.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import os

  from firecrawl import Firecrawl

  firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key=os.environ["FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"])

  def collect_current_page_evidence(url: str) -> dict:
      # max_age=0 skips Firecrawl's cache for this request.
      doc = firecrawl.scrape(url, formats=["markdown"], max_age=0)

      metadata = doc.metadata
      requested_url = (metadata.source_url if metadata else None) or url
      response_url = metadata.url if metadata else None

      return {
          "markdown": doc.markdown or "",
          "status_code": metadata.status_code if metadata else None,
          "requested_url": requested_url,
          "response_url": response_url,
          "possible_redirect": bool(response_url and response_url != requested_url),
      }


  evidence = collect_current_page_evidence("https://example.com/resource")
  # Apply source-specific content, status, API, or identifier checks here.
  # If they are inconclusive, keep the state unknown.
  ```

  ```js Node
  import { Firecrawl } from "firecrawl";

  const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY });

  async function collectCurrentPageEvidence(url) {
    // maxAge: 0 skips Firecrawl's cache for this request.
    const doc = await firecrawl.scrape(url, {
      formats: ["markdown"],
      maxAge: 0,
    });

    const requestedURL = doc.metadata?.sourceURL ?? url;
    const responseURL = doc.metadata?.url;

    return {
      markdown: doc.markdown ?? "",
      statusCode: doc.metadata?.statusCode,
      requestedURL,
      responseURL,
      possibleRedirect: Boolean(responseURL && responseURL !== requestedURL),
    };
  }

  const evidence = await collectCurrentPageEvidence("https://example.com/resource");
  // Apply source-specific content, status, API, or identifier checks here.
  // If they are inconclusive, keep the state unknown.
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -s -X POST "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://example.com/resource",
      "formats": ["markdown"],
      "maxAge": 0
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The important boundary is after collection: Firecrawl supplies page evidence; your application interprets that evidence using source-specific rules. If those rules are inconclusive, keep the state `unknown`.

## Recommendations by Scenario

| Scenario                                                   | Recommended approach                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Read product copy, docs, or reference content              | Omit `maxAge` and use the default cache window                           |
| Dashboard or report refreshed on a schedule                | Non-zero `maxAge` sized to your refresh interval                         |
| Final check before an action that depends on current state | `maxAge: 0` to skip the cache + the checklist above                      |
| Confirming an object is truly still active                 | Prefer the source's API or status field; treat a scrape as evidence only |
| Ambiguous rendered page (200 but no positive signal)       | Classify as `unknown`; stop before the irreversible step                 |

***

## Key Takeaways

1. **Freshness and liveness are different questions.** `maxAge` controls freshness; liveness is a decision you make from evidence.

2. **HTTP 200 plus content does not prove that the represented state is current.**

3. **For freshness-sensitive actions, use `maxAge: 0` and follow the checklist.** Inspect the rendered content, compare `metadata.url` against `metadata.sourceURL` for possible redirect evidence, and prefer source-specific APIs.

4. **Treat inconclusive evidence as `unknown`.** A scrape alone should never upgrade an object to `active`; stop before expensive or irreversible steps.

5. **Firecrawl has no liveness field.** Your application makes that determination in its own domain terms.
