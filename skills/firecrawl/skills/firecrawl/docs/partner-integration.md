# Partner Integration API

> API reference for approved Firecrawl partners to create and manage API keys for their users

## Overview

The Firecrawl Partner Integration API allows approved partners to create and manage Firecrawl API keys for their users directly from within their own platform. This enables a seamless onboarding experience where users can start using Firecrawl without leaving the partner's platform.


  Partner API access is **only available to approved Firecrawl partners**. Partner keys are shared privately with approved partners. To apply for the partner program or request a partner API key, email [partnerships@firecrawl.dev](mailto:partnerships@firecrawl.dev).


For details on what partner users receive, including credits, expiration, and plan limits, see [Partner Credits](/partner-credits).

## Base URL

```
https://integrations.firecrawl.dev
```

## Authentication

All Partner Integration API requests require an `Authorization` header with your partner key:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <partner key>
```

Partner keys are distinct from standard Firecrawl API keys and are provided directly by the Firecrawl team.

## Security Requirements

* **Server-side only**: Partner keys must only be used in server-side code. Never expose a partner key in frontend code, client-side JavaScript, or mobile applications.
* **Terms of Service**: Before calling `POST /partner/v1/accounts`, your platform must prompt the user to accept Firecrawl's [Terms of Service](https://www.firecrawl.dev/terms-of-service).

## Endpoints

### Create user

Creates a Firecrawl API key associated with the user's email address.

```
POST /partner/v1/accounts
```

#### Behavior

* If the user does not yet have a Firecrawl account, a new user and team will be created.
* If the user already has a Firecrawl account but does not have a team associated with your partner integration, a new partner-associated team will be created.
* If the user already has a Firecrawl account and already has a team associated with your partner integration, the existing team is returned and the promotional coupon is **not** re-applied.

#### Request

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://integrations.firecrawl.dev/partner/v1/accounts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <partner key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}'
```

### Validate API Key

Validates a Firecrawl API key and returns the associated team name and user email address. The API key will only return as valid if it was created through this partner integration.

```
POST /partner/v1/api-keys/validate
```

#### Important Notes

* Firecrawl API keys do not have permissions or an expiry date.
* API keys can be manually deleted by users at any time.
* Deleted API keys are not soft-deleted. Firecrawl cannot distinguish a deleted key from one that never existed.
