# Build with AI

> Everything you need to onboard your AI agent to Firecrawl.

If you're developing with AI, Firecrawl offers several resources to improve your experience. Firecrawl ships with **skills** — self-contained knowledge packs that AI coding agents discover and use automatically. One install command gives agents CLI tools for live web work and build skills for integrating Firecrawl into application code. Agents like Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, and OpenCode can self-onboard with a single command — no human setup required after the API key exists.

* [Prerequisite: Create an API Key](#prerequisite-create-an-api-key)
* [Skill + CLI](#skill-cli)
* [Using Firecrawl as a Tool](#using-firecrawl-as-a-tool)
* [Firecrawl MCP Server](#firecrawl-mcp-server)

* [Quick Start Guides](#quick-start-guides)
* [Agent Harnesses](#agent-harnesses)
* [SDKs](#sdks)

## Prerequisite: Create an API Key

Currently, we require a human to create a Firecrawl account. Once you have an account, you'll need to [create an API key](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys). With an API key, your agent can handle the rest — installing the skill, authenticating the CLI, wiring up MCP, and making calls on your behalf.


  Sign up and grab an API key to start using Firecrawl.


## Skill + CLI

The [Firecrawl CLI](/sdks/cli) lets your agent search, scrape, crawl, extract, and drive a browser from the terminal. It's built for humans, AI agents, and CI/CD pipelines.

The Firecrawl **Skill** is a self-contained knowledge pack that AI coding agents like Claude Code, Antigravity, and OpenCode discover and use automatically. A single install command sets up everything — the CLI tools for live web work and the build skills for integrating Firecrawl into application code:

```bash
npx -y firecrawl-cli@latest init --all --browser
```

* `--all` installs the Firecrawl skill to every detected AI coding agent on the machine
* `--browser` opens the browser so the human can sign in or create an account

After install, verify everything is working:

```bash
firecrawl --status
firecrawl scrape "https://firecrawl.dev"
```

### What the install gives you

The install sets up two categories of skills that cover every way an agent uses Firecrawl:

**CLI skills** — for live web work during an agent session:

| Skill                | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `firecrawl/cli`      | Overall CLI command workflow             |
| `firecrawl-search`   | Search the web and discover pages        |
| `firecrawl-scrape`   | Extract clean content from a known URL   |
| `firecrawl-interact` | Drive a live page — clicks, forms, login |
| `firecrawl-crawl`    | Bulk-extract content from an entire site |
| `firecrawl-map`      | Discover all URLs on a domain            |

**Build skills** — for integrating Firecrawl into application code:

| Skill                        | Purpose                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `firecrawl-build`            | Choose the right Firecrawl endpoint for your product |
| `firecrawl-build-onboarding` | Auth and project setup                               |
| `firecrawl-build-scrape`     | Implement scraping in app code                       |
| `firecrawl-build-search`     | Implement search in app code                         |
| `firecrawl-build-interact`   | Implement browser interaction in app code            |
| `firecrawl-build-crawl`      | Implement crawling in app code                       |
| `firecrawl-build-map`        | Implement URL discovery in app code                  |

### Choose your path

Both skill categories use the same install. The difference is what happens next:


    Use this when you need web data during your current session — searching the web, scraping known URLs, interacting with live pages, crawling docs, or mapping a site.

    The default flow:

    1. Start with **search** when you need discovery
    2. Move to **scrape** when you have a URL
    3. Use **interact** only when the page needs clicks, forms, or login

    ```bash
    # Search the web
    firecrawl search "best open-source web crawlers"

    # Scrape a page into clean markdown
    firecrawl scrape https://docs.firecrawl.dev

    # Crawl a whole site
    firecrawl crawl https://docs.firecrawl.dev
    ```


    Use this when you're building an application, agent, or workflow that calls the Firecrawl API from code. The build skills help with picking the right endpoint, wiring up the SDK, and running a smoke test.

    The agent answers one key question — *what should Firecrawl do in the product?* — and the build skill routes to `/search`, `/scrape`, `/interact`, `/crawl`, or `/map` accordingly.


    If you prefer not to install anything, agents can call the Firecrawl REST API directly. Set the API key and hit the endpoints:

    * `POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search` — discover pages by query
    * `POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape` — extract clean markdown from a URL
    * `POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/interact` — browser actions on live pages

    Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY`


The full skill definition is available at [`firecrawl.dev/agent-onboarding/SKILL.md`](https://www.firecrawl.dev/agent-onboarding/SKILL.md) — agents can fetch it directly for self-onboarding.


  Install the CLI and skill, authenticate, and run scrape, search, crawl, extract, and browser commands from the terminal.


## Using Firecrawl as a Tool

Firecrawl gives agents five core tools for working with the web. Each tool maps to an API endpoint and a CLI command. Agents pick the right tool based on what they need:


    Start here when you don't have a URL yet. Search returns relevant web pages for a natural-language query, with optional full-page content included in the results.

    ```bash
    # CLI
    firecrawl search "latest OpenAI API pricing"
    ```

    ```bash
    # REST API
    curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"query": "latest OpenAI API pricing"}'
    ```

    **When to use:** Research tasks, finding documentation, competitive analysis, answering questions that require up-to-date web information.


    Use this when you already have a URL and need clean, LLM-ready content. Scrape converts any web page into markdown, HTML, or structured data — handling JavaScript rendering, anti-bot measures, and messy HTML automatically.

    ```bash
    # CLI
    firecrawl scrape https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges
    ```

    ```bash
    # REST API
    curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url": "https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges"}'
    ```

    **When to use:** Reading documentation, extracting article content, pulling data from a known page, converting web pages to context for LLMs.


    Crawl recursively follows links from a starting URL and scrapes every page it finds. Use it when you need content from an entire site or documentation set, not just a single page.

    ```bash
    # CLI
    firecrawl crawl https://docs.firecrawl.dev --limit 50
    ```

    ```bash
    # REST API
    curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/crawl \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev", "limit": 50}'
    ```

    **When to use:** Ingesting full documentation sites, building knowledge bases, migrating content, training data collection.


    Map rapidly discovers every indexed URL on a domain without scraping the content. Use it when you need to understand a site's structure or find specific pages before scraping them.

    ```bash
    # CLI
    firecrawl map https://docs.firecrawl.dev
    ```

    ```bash
    # REST API
    curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/map \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev"}'
    ```

    **When to use:** Site audits, finding specific pages on a large site, understanding site structure before a targeted crawl.


    Interact gives agents control of a remote browser session. Use it when a page requires clicks, form fills, login, or any action beyond passive reading.

    ```bash
    # CLI
    firecrawl interact https://example.com --instruction "Click the login button, fill in the email field"
    ```

    ```bash
    # REST API
    curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/interact \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "instruction": "Click the login button"}'
    ```

    **When to use:** Pages behind login walls, filling out forms, navigating multi-step flows, interacting with dynamic SPAs.


### How agents chain tools together

Most agent workflows combine multiple tools. A typical pattern:

1. **Search** to find relevant pages → get a list of URLs
2. **Scrape** the most relevant URLs → get clean content
3. **Interact** only if a page needs clicks or login → handle dynamic content

For bulk work, agents use **Map** to discover URLs first, then **Crawl** or selectively **Scrape** the pages they need.

## Firecrawl MCP Server

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Among other benefits, it gives LLMs tools to act on your behalf. Our [MCP server](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server) is open-source and covers our full API surface — search, scrape, crawl, map, extract, agent, and browser sessions.

Use the remote hosted URL:

```
https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/{FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}/v2/mcp
```

Or add the local server to any MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "fc-YOUR-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Firecrawl Docs for Agents

You can give your agent current Firecrawl docs in a context-aware way. Agents can self-onboard by pulling these resources directly — no human wiring required.


    Every page has a markdown version. Append `.md` to any docs URL, or use the page action menu to copy the page as markdown.

    ```
    Docs for this page: https://docs.firecrawl.dev/ai-onboarding.md
    ```


    Give your agent all of our docs in a single file.

    ```
    Here are the Firecrawl docs: https://docs.firecrawl.dev/llms-full.txt
    ```

    A shorter index is also available at `https://docs.firecrawl.dev/llms.txt`.


    For a structured approach using MCP tools, connect the Firecrawl MCP server in any MCP client (Cursor, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Windsurf). See the [MCP Server](/mcp-server) page for install commands.


    Every page includes a contextual action menu (copy, view as markdown, open in ChatGPT, open in Claude) so agents and humans can move pages between tools in one click.

## Agent Harnesses

Firecrawl works with the runtimes and frameworks agents actually live inside — coding agents, browser agents, agent SDKs, and model aggregators. Most coding harnesses can auto-discover the Firecrawl skill via `npx -y firecrawl-cli@latest init --all`; the rest call Firecrawl as a tool over MCP or the REST API.
