# Overview

> Overview of the Firecrawl dashboard and its key features

The [Firecrawl dashboard](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app) is where you manage your account, test endpoints, and monitor usage. Below is a quick tour of each section.

## Playground

The playground lets you try Firecrawl endpoints directly in the browser before integrating them into your code.

* **[Scrape](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/playground?endpoint=scrape)** — Extract content from a single page.
* **[Search](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/playground?endpoint=search)** — Search the web and get scraped results.
* **[Crawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/playground?endpoint=crawl)** — Crawl an entire website and extract content from every page.
* **[Map](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/playground?endpoint=map)** — Discover all URLs on a website.

## Browser

[Interact with the web](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/browser) through a live browser session. You can create persistent profiles, run actions, and take screenshots — useful for pages that require authentication or complex interaction.

## Agent

The [Agent](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/agent) is an AI-powered research tool that can autonomously browse the web, follow links, and extract structured data based on a prompt.

## Activity Logs

[Activity Logs](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/logs) show a history of your recent API requests, including status, duration, and credits consumed.

## Usage

The [Usage](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/usage) page shows your credit consumption over time and current billing-cycle totals.

## API Keys

From the [API Keys](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys) page you can create, view, and revoke API keys for your team. Your account must always have at least one active API key, so to revoke a key you will need to create a new one first.

## Settings

The [Settings](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings) page has three tabs:

* **Team** — Invite members, assign roles, and manage your team. See [Team management & roles](#team-management--roles) below.
* **Billing** — View your current plan, invoices, auto-recharge settings, and apply coupons. See also [Billing](/billing).
* **Advanced** — Webhook signing secret and team deletion.

## Team management & roles

Firecrawl lets you invite teammates to collaborate under a shared account. From the **Team** tab in Settings you can invite members, assign roles, and manage your team.

### Roles

Every team member is assigned one of two roles: **Admin** or **Member**. You choose the role when sending an invitation.

| Capability                                   | Admin | Member |
| -------------------------------------------- | :---: | :----: |
| **General**                                  |       |        |
| Use the team's API keys and shared resources |   ✓   |    ✓   |
| **Team management**                          |       |        |
| View the team member list                    |   ✓   |    ✓   |
| Leave the team                               |   ✓   |    ✓   |
| Invite new team members                      |   ✓   |    ✗   |
| Remove team members                          |   ✓   |    ✗   |
| Change a member's role                       |   ✓   |    ✗   |
| Revoke pending invitations                   |   ✓   |    ✗   |
| Edit the team name                           |   ✓   |    ✗   |
| **Billing**                                  |       |        |
| View invoices and usage                      |   ✓   |    ✓   |
| Apply credit coupons                         |   ✓   |    ✓   |
| Manage subscription and billing portal       |   ✓   |    ✗   |
| **Settings**                                 |       |        |
| View the webhook signing secret              |   ✓   |    ✓   |
| Regenerate the webhook signing secret        |   ✓   |    ✗   |
| Delete the team                              |   ✓   |    ✗   |

In short, **Admins** have full control over team management, billing, and settings, while **Members** can use the team's resources, view usage, and apply coupons but cannot modify the team or subscription.
