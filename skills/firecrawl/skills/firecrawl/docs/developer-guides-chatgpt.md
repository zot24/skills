# Use Firecrawl MCP in ChatGPT

> Add Firecrawl to ChatGPT with the native connector

Add Firecrawl to ChatGPT with the native Firecrawl app. You do not need to create a custom MCP connector or paste a server URL.

## Add to ChatGPT


  Open the Firecrawl app in ChatGPT and connect it.


1. Open the [Firecrawl app in ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/plugins?q=firecrawl).
2. Select **Firecrawl** and connect it. When ChatGPT opens Firecrawl in your browser, sign in, choose a team, and approve access.
3. In a chat, open the **+** menu and enable **Firecrawl** before you send a prompt. The connector must be attached to the conversation.

Do not put a Firecrawl API key in a server URL. To revoke access later, use [MCP settings](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/settings?tab=mcp).

## Try

With Firecrawl enabled, try:

```text theme={null}
Search the web for the latest Firecrawl release notes and summarize the sources.
```

```text theme={null}
Scrape firecrawl.dev and tell me what it does
```
