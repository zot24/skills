Apprise API uses standard HTTP status codes. Many error responses return a short message as `text/plain`. If you request JSON (send `Accept: application/json`), error responses include an `error` field.

| Code  | Meaning                         | Where you will see it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :---- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | OK                              | Request succeeded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `204` | No Content                      | No configuration exists for the requested key, or a stateless notify request had no valid URLs to notify.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `400` | Bad Request                     | Invalid payload, unsupported `type` or `format`, invalid tag definition, invalid recursion header, or a payload field mapping rule (`:source=target`) could not be resolved (e.g. the dot-notation path was not found in the payload or exceeded the maximum depth). |
| `403` | Forbidden                       | The server is configured to deny the request (for example, `APPRISE_CONFIG_LOCK=yes`, or `/cfg` listing is disabled).                                                                                                                                                |
| `405` | Method Not Allowed              | The request used an unsupported HTTP method for the endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `406` | Not Acceptable                  | The recursion limit has been reached, or the request was rejected by a server rule.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `417` | Expectation Failed              | Health check detected a blocking condition (for example, missing write permissions).                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `421` | Misdirected Request             | API-only mode is enabled and a web UI page was requested.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `424` | Failed Dependency               | At least one notification failed to send.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `431` | Request Header Fields Too Large | The request exceeded the configured in-memory upload limit and Django rejected it.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `500` | Internal Server Error           | Server-side error saving or loading configuration, or an unexpected I/O error.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

:::note
Some error cases are endpoint-specific and may return either `text/plain` or JSON depending on `Accept`.
