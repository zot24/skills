title: Fail2Ban
description: Using Apprise with Fail2ban for security event notifications
---


Fail2ban is a log-monitoring service that detects suspicious behaviour, such as repeated authentication failures, and automatically blocks offending IP addresses.

Apprise integrates with Fail2ban as a notification action, allowing you to receive alerts through any of Apprise’s supported services, including email, push notifications, chat platforms, and webhooks.

This guide assumes:

- A fresh Fail2ban installation
- systemd is available
- A single host configuration
- sshd is the first service being monitored

Distribution-specific paths and advanced jail configurations are intentionally deferred.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following are installed:

- Fail2ban
- Apprise (CLI)
- Apprise API is optional (if configuration is centralized)

Verify both are available:

```bash
fail2ban-client --version
apprise --version
```

## Installing Fail2ban

On most systems, Fail2ban is available via the system package manager.

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

Verify it is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```

## Configuring Apprise

Be sure to be comfortable with [Apprise Configuration Files](/getting-started/configuration/) and know which [service(s)](/services/) you plan on using. We will choose to assign the tag `fail2ban` to all of the end points we wish to be notified if an event occurs:

```ini
# /etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf
# Define our fail2ban configuration tag, and assign it to a Discord webhook
# as an example for the purpose of this guide.  But you can use any
# service you want.

## Configuring Apprise for Fail2ban

:::note[Detected IP]
For your convenience, this guide detected your public address as <code><MyIPAddr prefix={true} /></code>. If this is the workstation you will remote into your server from, you may wish to add this to the `ignore=` line.
:::

Add the following to `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`

```ini
# /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
[DEFAULT]

# ignoreip acts as a safelist; requests coming from these IPs are imune to
# Fail2Ban monitoring. Each entry is separated by a space (' ').
# You only want to specify safe access points:
#   - 127.0.0.1/8 : Localhost (this PC); you don't want Fail2Ban banning internal
#                   requests.. this one is safe to add. the `/8` is safe to leave
#                   on the end of the IP for this entry.
#   - YOUR_IP/32  : If you are accessing your server running Fail2Ban remotely, then
#                   replace the 'YOUR_IP/32' entry below with 'your actual IP address'.
#                   make sure to add `/32` if an IPv4 address or `/128` if it is an
#                   IPv6 address.
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 YOUR_IP/32

# how far back to look
findtime = 5m

# ban if we trigger on 4 failed authenticate within the findtime
maxretry = 4

# ban time; how long do we restrict this user from our system for?
bantime = 1d

#
# Now we define our Apprise Action
#
#   - Read from /etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf
#   - Only notify end points tagged with 'fail2ban'
#
action = apprise[config="/etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf", args="--tag fail2ban"]

#
# Now we will define our jails
#

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s

# Optionally over-ride our defaults above
maxretry = 5
findtime = 10m
bantime = 1h

# The below entry is not nessisary as it's defined in the [DEFAULT] section above
# but this is to show that you could also define another entry here as well
# and assign it a different set of tags.
action = apprise[config="/etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf", args="--tag fail2ban"]
```

:::tip
You can easily leverage an Apprise API instance by setting:

```ini
action = apprise[config="http://api.example.ca:8000/cfg/apprise-key", args="--tag fail2ban"]
```

:::

Restart Fail2ban:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

Verify the jail is active:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

## Testing Your Setup

Trigger a test ban by exceeding authentication attempts, or simulate manually:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client set sshd banip 203.0.113.10
```

You should receive an Apprise notification immediately.

## Troubleshooting

View Fail2ban logs:

```bash
journalctl -u fail2ban
```

Increase verbosity for Apprise actions (by adding `-vv` and test to see what might be going on:

```bash
apprise -vv --tag fail2ban --config /etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf \
     --body "fail2ban trigger test"
```

Confirm Apprise URLs independently before debugging Fail2ban.

## Useful Tips

Fail2ban is amazing, but it can be tedious to use at times. Sometimes it helps to have a few handy notes on the side to troubleshoot with:

```bash
# See all jails:
fail2ban-client status

# Look into the status of one of the specific jails
fail2ban-client status sshd

# quick and dirty way to unban an IP (regardless of which jail banned it)
fail2ban-client unban 1.2.3.4
```
