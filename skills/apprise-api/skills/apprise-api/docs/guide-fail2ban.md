title: Fail2Ban
description: Send Fail2ban alerts through Apprise and protect Apprise API
---


Fail2ban is a log-monitoring service that detects suspicious behaviour, such as repeated authentication failures, and automatically blocks offending IP addresses.

Apprise integrates with Fail2ban as a notification action, allowing you to receive alerts through any of Apprise's supported services, including email, push notifications, chat platforms, and webhooks.

This guide assumes:

- A fresh Fail2ban installation
- systemd is available
- A single host configuration
- sshd is the first service being monitored

Distribution-specific paths and advanced jail configurations are intentionally deferred.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following are installed:

- Fail2ban
- Apprise (CLI)
- Apprise API is optional (if configuration is centralized)

Verify both are available:

```bash
fail2ban-client --version
apprise --version
```

## Installing Fail2ban

On most systems, Fail2ban is available via the system package manager.

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

Verify it is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```

## Configuring Apprise

Be sure to be comfortable with [Apprise Configuration Files](/getting-started/configuration/) and know which [service(s)](/services/) you plan on using. We will choose to assign the tag `fail2ban` to all of the end points we wish to be notified if an event occurs:

```ini
# /etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf
# Define our fail2ban configuration tag, and assign it to a Discord webhook
# as an example for the purpose of this guide.  But you can use any
# service you want.
fail2ban=discord://4174216298/JHMHI8qBe7bk2ZwO5U711o3dV_js

```

## Configuring Apprise for Fail2ban

:::note[Detected IP]
For your convenience, this guide detected your public address as <code><MyIPAddr prefix={true} /></code>. If this is the workstation you will remote into your server from, you may wish to add this to the `ignore=` line.
:::

Add the following to `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`

```ini
# /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
[DEFAULT]

# ignoreip acts as a safelist; requests coming from these IPs are immune to
# Fail2Ban monitoring. Each entry is separated by a space (' ').
# You only want to specify safe access points:
#   - 127.0.0.1/8 : Localhost (this PC); you don't want Fail2Ban banning internal
#                   requests.. this one is safe to add. the `/8` is safe to leave
#                   on the end of the IP for this entry.
#   - YOUR_IP/32  : If you are accessing your server running Fail2Ban remotely, then
#                   replace the 'YOUR_IP/32' entry below with 'your actual IP address'.
#                   make sure to add `/32` if an IPv4 address or `/128` if it is an
#                   IPv6 address.
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 YOUR_IP/32

# how far back to look
findtime = 5m

# ban if we trigger on 4 failed authenticate within the findtime
maxretry = 4

# ban time; how long do we restrict this user from our system for?
bantime = 1d

#
# Now we define our Apprise Action
#
#   - Read from /etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf
#   - Only notify end points tagged with 'fail2ban'
#
action = apprise[config="/etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf", args="--tag fail2ban"]

#
# Now we will define our jails
#

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s

# Optionally over-ride our defaults above
maxretry = 5
findtime = 10m
bantime = 1h

# The entry below is not necessary because it is defined in [DEFAULT] above,
# but this is to show that you could also define another entry here as well
# and assign it a different set of tags.
action = apprise[config="/etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf", args="--tag fail2ban"]
```

:::tip
You can easily leverage an Apprise API instance by setting:

```ini
action = apprise[config="http://api.example.ca:8000/cfg/apprise-key", args="--tag fail2ban"]
```

This form assumes Apprise API authentication is disabled. If authentication
is enabled, use an HTTPS configuration URL with suitable credentials and keep
the file containing it readable only by the account running Fail2ban.

:::

Restart Fail2ban:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

Verify the jail is active:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

## Testing Your Setup

Trigger a test ban by exceeding authentication attempts, or simulate manually:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client set sshd banip 203.0.113.10
```

You should receive an Apprise notification immediately.

## Protecting Apprise API

Fail2ban can also monitor the nginx access log in front of Apprise API and ban clients that repeatedly fail authentication, ignore rate limits, or probe unsupported routes.

Apprise API uses ordinary nginx access-log lines in both regular and strict mode. Strict mode additionally limits authentication traffic and accepts only known routes. It returns standard statuses that a reverse proxy can relay and log:

- `401` means credentials were missing or invalid.
- `404` means the route does not exist.
- `405` means the route exists but does not accept that HTTP method.
- `429` means nginx temporarily rate-limited the client.

Do not treat every `403` as an authentication failure. Apprise can return `403` when valid credentials belong to an account that is not permitted to perform the requested operation.

### Choose the Access Log

When a host nginx reverse proxy fronts the container, give the Apprise virtual host its own log:

```nginx
access_log /var/log/nginx/apprise_access.log combined;
```

This is the simplest arrangement because the outer log already contains the connecting client's address.

If the container is exposed directly, you can instead bind-mount `/var/log/apprise` and add both destinations to `/etc/nginx/server-override.conf`:

```nginx
access_log /dev/stdout combined if=$apprise_access_loggable;
access_log /var/log/apprise/access.log combined if=$apprise_access_loggable;
```

Ensure the directory is writable by the container's `PUID`, then use `/var/log/apprise/access.log` in the jail examples below.

### Create the Filters

Create `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-apprise-auth.conf`:

```ini
[Definition]
# Missing or invalid credentials. A valid but unauthorized user receives 403.
failregex = ^<HOST> - \S+ \[[^]]+\] "[^"]*" 401 \d+
ignoreregex =
```

Create `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-apprise-rate-limit.conf`:

```ini
[Definition]
# The client continued after nginx began returning Too Many Requests.
failregex = ^<HOST> - \S+ \[[^]]+\] "[^"]*" 429 \d+
ignoreregex =
```

Create `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-apprise-probe.conf`:

```ini
[Definition]
# Repeated malformed requests, missing routes, unsupported methods, oversized
# requests, long URIs, or requests sent to the wrong virtual host.
failregex = ^<HOST> - \S+ \[[^]]+\] "[^"]*" (?:400|404|405|413|414|421|431) \d+
ignoreregex =
```

If you already have a generic nginx `429` filter, add the Apprise access log to that jail instead of creating another copy.

### Create the Jails

Add the following to `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`. These values are cautious starting points; tune them after observing normal traffic:

```ini
[nginx-apprise-auth]
enabled  = true
filter   = nginx-apprise-auth
port     = http,https
logpath  = /var/log/nginx/apprise_access.log
findtime = 10m
maxretry = 6
bantime  = 1h

[nginx-apprise-rate-limit]
enabled  = true
filter   = nginx-apprise-rate-limit
port     = http,https
logpath  = /var/log/nginx/apprise_access.log
findtime = 5m
maxretry = 10
bantime  = 1h

[nginx-apprise-probe]
enabled  = true
filter   = nginx-apprise-probe
port     = http,https
logpath  = /var/log/nginx/apprise_access.log
findtime = 10m
maxretry = 10
bantime  = 1d
```

### Preserve the Real Client Address

Fail2ban must never ban the reverse proxy in place of the client. The host proxy should replace, rather than append to, the forwarded address:

```nginx
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
```

The Apprise container also needs the real address for its own strict-mode rate limits. Trust only the exact proxy or Docker gateway in `/etc/nginx/server-override.conf`:

```nginx
set_real_ip_from 172.17.0.1; # Replace with the exact trusted proxy address.
real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
real_ip_recursive on;
```

Do not place an entire Docker or private network in `set_real_ip_from` unless every device on that network is trusted.

### Validate Before Restarting

Test each filter against real log entries:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-regex /var/log/nginx/apprise_access.log \
  /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-apprise-auth.conf
sudo fail2ban-regex /var/log/nginx/apprise_access.log \
  /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-apprise-rate-limit.conf
sudo fail2ban-regex /var/log/nginx/apprise_access.log \
  /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-apprise-probe.conf
```

Then validate and reload Fail2ban:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client -t
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status nginx-apprise-auth
sudo fail2ban-client status nginx-apprise-rate-limit
sudo fail2ban-client status nginx-apprise-probe
```

## Troubleshooting

View Fail2ban logs:

```bash
journalctl -u fail2ban
```

Increase verbosity for Apprise actions (by adding `-vv` and test to see what might be going on:

```bash
apprise -vv --tag fail2ban --config /etc/fail2ban/apprise.conf \
     --body "fail2ban trigger test"
```

Confirm Apprise URLs independently before debugging Fail2ban.

## Useful Tips

Fail2ban is amazing, but it can be tedious to use at times. Sometimes it helps to have a few handy notes on the side to troubleshoot with:

```bash
# See all jails:
fail2ban-client status

# Look into the status of one of the specific jails
fail2ban-client status sshd

# quick and dirty way to unban an IP (regardless of which jail banned it)
fail2ban-client unban 1.2.3.4
```
