title: Template Variables
description: Declare reusable YAML values and supply them from the CLI, API, or environment.

  order: 4.5

Template variables let an administrator leave selected YAML values open until
a notification is sent. They are useful for shared configurations and secrets
provided by an automation platform.

## Define a Template

Declare each name under `template:`, then use `${NAME}` in a URL or one of its
settings:

```yaml title="apprise.yml"
template:
  recipient:
  smtp_host: smtp.example.com

urls:
  - mailtos://user:password@example.com/:
      - smtp: ${SMTP_HOST}
        to: ${RECIPIENT}
        tag: alerts
```

`recipient` must be supplied later. `smtp_host` has a default.

## Simple Rules

- Templates work only in YAML configuration.
- A marker is replaced only when its name is declared under `template:`.
  Undeclared `${NAME}` text remains unchanged.
- `tag:` and `tags:` cannot contain template markers.
- The service name before `://` cannot be a template. For example,
  `${SERVICE}://...` is invalid.
- Names are case-insensitive and may contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Values are substituted once and otherwise kept as supplied.

If an entry still needs a value, Apprise skips that entry and continues with
the others.

## Supplying Values

Apprise uses the first available value in this order:

1. A value supplied with the notification
2. The default in `template:`
3. `APPRISE_TEMPLATE_<NAME>` from the environment

Blank notification and environment values are ignored. An explicit empty YAML
string, such as `name: ""`, is still a valid default.


Declare names as a mapping, as shown above, or as a list:

```yaml
template:
  - recipient
  - smtp_host: smtp.example.com
```

Both forms behave the same way. A name without a value must be supplied when
the notification is sent or through the environment.


Supply a declared value with `--template-var` or `-tv`:

```bash
apprise --config apprise.yml --tag alerts \
  --template-var recipient=admin@example.com \
  --body "Backup complete"
```

Repeat the option for different names. You can also use the environment:

```bash
export APPRISE_TEMPLATE_RECIPIENT=admin@example.com
apprise --config apprise.yml --tag alerts --body "Backup complete"
```

Add `--dry-run` to report missing values without sending.


For a saved configuration, send values in a JSON `template` object:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tag": "alerts",
    "body": "Backup complete",
    "template": {"recipient": "admin@example.com"}
  }' \
  http://localhost:8000/notify/my-alerts
```

Form requests use `template[name]`, such as
`template[recipient]=admin@example.com`.


## URL or Named Setting

A marker may appear directly in a URL or in a named YAML setting:

```yaml
urls:
  # The value fills this part of the URL
  - mailtos://user:password@example.com/${RECIPIENT}

  # The value is limited to the "to" option
  - mailtos://user:password@example.com/:
      - to: ${RECIPIENT}
```

:::caution
URL markers use direct substitution, which is useful when you trust whoever
supplies the value. On shared or enterprise systems, use named YAML settings
for values from other users so each value stays within one option.
:::

Characters such as `/`, `?`, `&`, `#`, `@`, and `:` stay in the selected
field instead of becoming new URL options. When one marker replaces the entire
host or username, it may also supply the supported `user@host` or `user:pass`
form. A few services validate fields while loading; if a marker is rejected,
use another supported position or a named setting.

## Additional Behavior

- A name may be used more than once and receives the same value everywhere.
- A supplied value containing `${OTHER}` is not expanded again.
- Extra supplied names are ignored and recorded by name in the local debug log.
- Names may be up to 32 characters and values up to 1,024 characters.
- Repeated `template:` or `urls:` sections make the YAML invalid.
- If some matching entries send while others lack values, the result is
  `PARTIAL`. If every matching entry lacks a value, the result is `FAILURE`.
