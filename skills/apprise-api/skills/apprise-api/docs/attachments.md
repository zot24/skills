Attachments let you send files such as images, logs, PDFs, and artifacts alongside your message. Whether they arrive as true attachments depends on what the destination service supports.

## CLI attachments

Use `--attach` one or more times:

```bash
apprise -t "System Alert" -b "See attached log" \
  --attach /var/log/syslog \
  "mailto://user:pass@example.com"

apprise -b "Here are the files" \
  --attach /tmp/photo1.jpg \
  --attach /tmp/photo2.jpg \
  "tgram://..."
```

## Python Attachments

Pass a single path or a list of paths via `attach`:

```python
from apprise import Apprise

apobj = Apprise()
apobj.add("tgram://...")

# Single attachment
apobj.notify(body="See attached", attach="/path/to/file.txt")

# Multiple attachments
apobj.notify(
    body="Artifacts attached",
    attach=[
        "/path/to/build.log",
        "/path/to/report.pdf",
    ],
)
```

## Remote Attachments (URLs)

You can also provide a URL and Apprise will fetch it before delivering:

```python
# Apprise will download this image and send it to the destination
# if you provide a user/pass combo, it will even authenticate for you
# prior to retrieving the attachment
apobj.notify(
    body="Security Camera Snapshot",
    attach="http://admin:pass@example.local/cam/snapshot.jpg"
)
```

:::caution
If a remote attachment URL includes credentials, treat it like a secret. Avoid committing it into repositories or logs.

## In-Memory Attachments (AttachMemory)

When you generate content on the fly — rendered HTML, chart images, CSVs, PDFs — you can pass it directly as an `AttachMemory` object without writing anything to disk.


Pass a string or `bytes` directly — no temporary file is created:

```python
import apprise
from apprise.attachment import AttachMemory

apobj = apprise.Apprise()
apobj.add("discord://webhook_id/webhook_token/")

apobj.notify(
    body="Today's readings are attached.",
    attach=AttachMemory(
        content="date,value\n2026-03-20,42\n2026-03-21,38\n",
        name="readings.csv",
        mimetype="text/csv",
    ),
)
```

`str` content is encoded to UTF-8 automatically. Use `bytes` if you already have binary data.


Generate an image with [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) and send it without saving to disk:

```python
import io
import apprise
from apprise.attachment import AttachMemory
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

# Draw a simple image
img = Image.new("RGB", (400, 200), color=(30, 30, 30))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
draw.text((20, 80), "Hello from Apprise!", fill=(255, 255, 0))

# Render to an in-memory buffer
buf = io.BytesIO()
img.save(buf, format="PNG")

apobj = apprise.Apprise()
apobj.add("tgram://bottoken/ChatID")

apobj.notify(
    body="Generated image attached.",
    attach=AttachMemory(
        content=buf.getvalue(),
        name="hello.png",
        mimetype="image/png",
    ),
)
```


Render a chart with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and attach it directly:

```python
import io
import apprise
from apprise.attachment import AttachMemory
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Build the chart
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 24, 18, 32])
ax.set_title("Daily metric")
ax.set_xlabel("Day")
ax.set_ylabel("Value")

# Render to an in-memory buffer
buf = io.BytesIO()
fig.savefig(buf, format="png")
plt.close(fig)

apobj = apprise.Apprise()
apobj.add("tgram://bottoken/ChatID")

apobj.notify(
    body="Nightly trend chart attached.",
    attach=AttachMemory(
        content=buf.getvalue(),
        name="trend.png",
        mimetype="image/png",
    ),
)
```
