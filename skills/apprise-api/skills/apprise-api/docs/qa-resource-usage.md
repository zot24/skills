**Is the Apprise API Docker container using more RAM or memory than you expect?**
The table below maps your usage level to the right settings. For most personal and hobbyist deployments, a few environment variables are all it takes.

## Quick Reference

| Profile         | Daily Notifications | `APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT` | `APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS` | Expected RAM |
| :-------------- | :-----------------: | :--------------------: | :---------------------------: | :----------: |
| **Hobbyist**    |       1 – 50        |          `1`           |             `50`              | ~150–180 MB  |
| **Light**       |      51 – 500       |          `1`           |             `200`             | ~180–220 MB  |
| **Medium**      |     501 – 5,000     |          `2`           |             `500`             | ~330–400 MB  |
| **Heavy**       |   5,001 – 20,000    |         `3–4`          |      `1000` _(default)_       | ~500–700 MB  |
| **High-volume** |       20,000+       |        _(auto)_        |      `1000` _(default)_       |    varies    |

:::tip[Hobbyist / Home server]
`APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT=1` with `APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS=50` keeps memory use low. **~150–180 MB is the realistic minimum** for this stack — it is the fixed cost of running Python, Django, and Apprise's full plugin suite, and cannot be reduced further through tuning alone.

## Applying the Settings

The following provides an example of how you can apply the settings to your deployment. Choose the tab that matches your setup.


```bash
docker run --name apprise \
  -e APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT=1 \
  -e APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS=50 \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./config:/config \
  -d caronc/apprise:latest
```


```yaml
services:
  apprise:
    image: caronc/apprise:latest
    environment:
      APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT: 1
      APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS: 50
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
```

To cap the container's RAM and prevent unbounded growth, add a memory limit:

```yaml
mem_limit: 256m # safe floor for 1-worker deployments
```

:::caution
If the container hits its memory limit, Docker will terminate it with an out-of-memory (OOM) error. **256 MB** is a safe floor for single-worker deployments; **384 MB** provides a comfortable margin.

## Why Is ~150 MB the Minimum?

The container always runs three processes regardless of settings:

| Process         |     RAM     | Notes                                 |
| :-------------- | :---------: | :------------------------------------ |
| Nginx           |   ~25 MB    | Reverse proxy                         |
| Supervisord     |   ~10 MB    | Process manager                       |
| Gunicorn worker | ~115–145 MB | Python + Django + all Apprise plugins |

The worker is the main driver. Apprise loads **all {/_ SERVICES:COUNT _/} notification services at startup** — even ones you will never use. This is what creates the fixed baseline. The core Python, Django, and service scaffolding always loads; however, optional third-party libraries used only by specific services can be evicted at startup if those services are disabled (see [Reducing Memory Further with Service Filtering](#advanced-reducing-memory-further-with-service-filtering)).

The default worker count is `(2 × CPU cores) + 1`. On a 2-core host that is **5 workers**, which can push usage to 700 MB or more before a single notification is sent. Reducing to `APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT=1` has the most effect on memory use.

## Why Does Memory Grow Over Time?

Python's internal allocator retains freed memory rather than returning it to the OS immediately — this is normal, not a leak. Memory is only fully released when a worker **restarts**.

`APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS` controls how many requests a worker handles before restarting. With the default of `1000` and only a handful of notifications per day, workers may run for months without ever recycling. Setting this to a lower value (e.g., `50`) ensures periodic restarts that keep memory closer to the startup baseline.

## Advanced: Jitter

`APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER` adds a random offset to each worker's restart threshold to prevent all workers from recycling simultaneously.

- **Single-worker deployments**: jitter has no effect. The default of `50` is harmless, or you can set it to `0`.
- **Multi-worker deployments**: leave jitter at the default `50`, or scale it proportionally if you lower `APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS` significantly (e.g., `MAX_REQUESTS=50` → `JITTER=10`).

Jitter does not affect memory usage — only `APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT` and `APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS` do.

| :----------------------------------- | :------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT`               | `(2×CPUs) + 1` | Number of Gunicorn workers. Set to `1` for low-resource deployments.               |
| `APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS`        |     `1000`     | Requests before a worker restarts and releases accumulated memory.                 |
| `APPRISE_WORKER_MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER` |      `50`      | Random offset per worker to stagger restarts. Irrelevant for single-worker setups. |
| `APPRISE_WORKER_TIMEOUT`             |     `300`      | Worker timeout in seconds.                                                         |

## Advanced: Reducing Memory Further with Service Filtering

If you only use a small set of notification services, you can reclaim additional memory by telling the API which services you actually need. The Apprise API will evict the optional libraries used exclusively by the disabled plugins from memory at startup.

```bash
APPRISE_ALLOW_SERVICES=tgram,ntfy
```

Libraries that are no longer needed by any enabled plugin are automatically removed from Python's module cache (`sys.modules`). The savings compound with `APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT=1`:
