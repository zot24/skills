Now that you have Apprise installed, let's send your first notification. Choose your preferred method below.


The quickest way to test Apprise is via the command line.

```bash
# Send a notification to a specific service
apprise -t "Hello" -b "World" \
    "discord://webhook_id/webhook_token"
```


If you are a developer, here is how you use Apprise in a Python script:

```python
import apprise

# Create an Apprise instance
apobj = apprise.Apprise()

# Add notification services using URLs
apobj.add('mailto://user:pass@gmail.com')
apobj.add('discord://webhook_id/webhook_token')

# Send a notification
apobj.notify(
    body='This is a test notification!',
    title='Hello World',
)
```


Ensure your Apprise API container is running (see [Installation](/getting-started/installation/)).

### 1. Stateless (Fastest)

You can send a notification immediately without configuring anything on the server by passing the URLs in the request.

```bash
# Send a notification via curl
curl -X POST \
  -d 'urls=discord://webhook_id/webhook_token' \
  -d 'body=Hello World' \
  http://localhost:8000/notify
```

### 2. The Web Interface

The API includes a built-in Configuration Manager at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Step 1: Choose a Key

Configurations are stored under a unique **Config ID** (or Key). Pick a keyword (e.g., `my-alerts`) to get started.

#### Step 2: Add Configuration

Enter your Apprise URLs (TEXT or YAML format) and save them to your Key.

#### Step 3: Review & Tag

Verify your URLs are loaded. You can see which **tags** are assigned to them, allowing you to target specific groups later.

#### Step 4: Send Notification

Switch to the **Notifications** tab. Select the tags you want to target (or leave blank to notify all) and fire away.

### Developer API (Swagger)

Apprise API follows the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. You can find the `swagger.yaml` spec [in the root of the repository](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api/blob/master/swagger.yaml).
