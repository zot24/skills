This guide covers the core functionality of the Apprise API: sending notifications. You can send notifications in two ways:

1. **Stateless:** You provide the configuration URLs in the request payload.
1. **Stateful:** You reference a pre-saved configuration Key.

## Response Formats

By default, endpoints return `text/plain`. If you prefer JSON, send `Accept: application/json`.

For notification endpoints (`/notify` and `/notify/{KEY}`), you can also request a simple HTML log view by sending `Accept: text/html`. This is mainly useful for human testing in a browser.

## Stateless Notifications

    media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
  />
  <img

    alt="Stateless API Integration"
    loading="lazy"

Stateless notifications are ideal for "sidecar" usage where you don't want to manage persistent configuration on the server. You must provide the `urls` parameter in every request.

### Basic JSON Request

The most common method is sending a JSON payload to `/notify`.

**Endpoint:** `POST /notify`

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "urls": "mailto://user:pass@gmail.com",
    "body": "Backup completed successfully.",
    "title": "System Status"
  }' \
  http://localhost:8000/notify
```

### File Attachments

To send attachments, use `multipart/form-data`. The API accepts standard file uploads or remote URLs. Use `attach` as the recommended field name. The aliases `attachment` and `attachments` are also accepted.

For JSON payloads that supply remote or encoded attachment values, use the same field names.

```bash
# Upload a local file
curl -X POST \
    -F "urls=discord://webhook_id/token" \
    -F "body=See attached log." \
    -F "attach=@/var/log/syslog" \
    http://localhost:8000/notify

# Reference a remote URL (Apprise will download and forward it)
curl -X POST \
    -F "urls=discord://webhook_id/token" \
    -F "body=Security Camera Snapshot" \
    -F "attach=http://camera-ip/snapshot.jpg" \
    http://localhost:8000/notify
```

## Stateful Notifications

<picture class="theme-aware-sf-diagram">
  <source
    srcset="../images/stateful-api-integration-dark.svg"
    media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
  />
  <img
    src="../images/stateful-api-integration-light.svg"
    alt="Stateful API Integration"
    loading="lazy"
  />
</picture>

Stateful notifications allow you to simplify your client code. You store the complex URLs on the server once, assigned to a **Key**, and your client simply references that Key.

**Endpoint:** `POST /notify/{KEY}`

### Sending to a Key

If you have saved a configuration under the key `my-alerts`:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "body": "Database connection failed",
    "type": "warning"
  }' \
  http://localhost:8000/notify/my-alerts
```

### Tagging

Stateful configurations support tagging, allowing you to notify specific subgroups of your saved URLs.

The value passed in the `tag` field follows these rules:

| `tag` value        | Selected services                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `"TagA"`           | Has `TagA`                                |
| `"TagA TagB"`      | Has `TagA` **AND** `TagB`                 |
| `"TagA+TagB"`      | Has `TagA` **AND** `TagB`                 |
| `"TagA&TagB"`      | Has `TagA` **AND** `TagB`                 |
| `"TagA,TagB"`      | Has `TagA` **OR** `TagB`                  |
| `"TagA\|TagB"`     | Has `TagA` **OR** `TagB`                  |
| `"TagA TagC,TagB"` | Has (`TagA` **AND** `TagC`) **OR** `TagB` |

```bash
# Notify services tagged "devops" OR "admin"
curl -X POST -d '{"tag": "devops,admin", "body": "..."}' ...

# Notify services tagged "devops" AND "critical"
curl -X POST -d '{"tag": "devops critical", "body": "..."}' ...

# Notify services matching ('comment' AND 'create') OR 'admin'
curl -X POST -d '{"tag": "comment create,admin", "body": "..."}' ...
```

## Payload Mapping (Hooks)

Sometimes you cannot change the payload format sent by a third-party tool (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus). Apprise API allows you to map incoming fields to Apprise-compatible fields using query parameters prefixed with a colon (`:`).

:::note
Mapping keys are passed in the query string and must be URL encoded if they contain special characters.
:::

### Mapping Rules

| Syntax                           | Effect                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `?:incoming_field=apprise_field` | Rename `incoming_field` to the Apprise field |
| `?:incoming_field=`              | Remove `incoming_field` from the payload     |
| `?:apprise_field=literal value`  | Hard-code `apprise_field` to a fixed string  |

**Example** — your tool sends `{"message": "Server Down", "severity": "high"}`, but Apprise expects `body` and `type`:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -d '{"message": "Server Down", "severity": "high"}' \
  "http://localhost:8000/notify/my-alerts?:message=body&:severity=type"
```

### Nested Field Mapping

When the incoming payload uses nested objects or arrays, reference them on the source side of the rule using **dot-notation** for nested objects and **bracket-notation** for array elements. Both can be freely combined.

#### Nested Objects (Dot-Notation)

Use a dot-separated path to walk into nested dictionaries:

```bash
# Payload from a monitoring tool:
# { "event": { "title": "CPU spike", "state": "critical" },
#   "component": { "name": "web-server-01" } }
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":{"title":"CPU spike","state":"critical"},"component":{"name":"web-server-01"}}' \
  "http://localhost:8000/notify/my-alerts?:event.title=title&:event.state=type&:component.name=body"
```

#### Array Elements (Bracket-Notation)

Append `[N]` directly after the key name to dereference index `N` of that array. Multiple subscripts and mixing with dot-notation are both supported:

```bash
# Payload from a forum / project-management webhook (e.g. Scoold / Para):
# { "items": [ { "title": "New post", "objectURI": "https://example.com/q/1234" } ] }
curl -g -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items":[{"title":"New post","objectURI":"https://example.com/q/1234"}]}' \
  "http://localhost:8000/notify/my-alerts?:items[0].title=title&:items[0].objectURI=body"
```

:::note
`curl` treats brackets in URLs as globbing syntax, so `-g` (or `--globoff`) is required when using mapping paths such as `items[0].title`. Keep the URL quoted so your shell passes it through unchanged.
:::

Chained subscripts traverse nested arrays:

```text
# Source key          What it resolves to
items[0]              first element of the items array
items[0].objectURI    .objectURI of the first element
matrix[0][1]          row 0, column 1 of a 2-D array
a[0][1][2].value[3]   nested arrays -> dict -> array
```

**Rules and limits:**

- Only the **source** side may use path notation; the target must be a flat Apprise field (`title`, `body`, `type`, `format`, `tag`, etc.).
- `N` in `[N]` must be a non-negative integer. Both `key[abc]` (non-integer) and `key[0` / `key0]` (unmatched bracket) are rejected with a `WARNING`.
- If any step in the path cannot be resolved (missing key, index out of range, or a non-list node encountered at an index step), the server returns **400** and logs a `WARNING` — no notification is sent. This lets you catch misconfigured rules without silently dropping messages.
- **Depth** is counted as the total number of individual traversal operations — each dict-key lookup _and_ each array-index dereference counts as one step. For example, `items[0].objectURI` is **3** steps (`items` -> `[0]` -> `objectURI`), and `a[0][1][2].b[3]` is **6** steps.
- The maximum traversal depth defaults to **5**. Adjust it with the `APPRISE_WEBHOOK_MAPPING_MAX_DEPTH` environment variable.
