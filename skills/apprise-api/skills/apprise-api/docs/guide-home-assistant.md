This guide explains how to integrate **Apprise** with **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)** using the built-in Apprise notification platform. This approach allows you to centralize all notification logic in a single configuration file (or Apprise API source) while letting Home Assistant focus purely on automation logic.

:::note[Sending notifications to Home Assistant instead?]
This guide covers using Apprise **from within** Home Assistant to deliver
notifications to external services. If you want to use Apprise to send
notifications **to** Home Assistant (persistent dashboard alerts or
direct service calls), see the
[Home Assistant service plugin](/services/homeassistant/) (`hassio://`).
:::

## Why Use Apprise with Home Assistant

Using Apprise provides several benefits:

- A single configuration file for all notification services
- Support for dozens of providers (email, Telegram, ntfy, Kodi, and more)
- Tag-based routing for flexible notification targeting
- No vendor lock-in at the automation level

Home Assistant remains unaware of provider details. It simply sends messages to Apprise and lets Apprise do the rest.

## 1. Installation

Apprise is built into Home Assistant Core. You do not need to install a custom component or add-on. It is available immediately via the `notify` platform.

## 2. Configuration

Choose the configuration method that best fits your needs.


This method works well for a quick setup or when you don't need to target different services individually. The `url` parameter accepts a single URL or a list of URLs — all of them are notified together on every call.

**Edit `configuration.yaml`**

Add one or more URLs directly to your configuration file.

```yaml
# /config/configuration.yaml
notify:
  - name: apprise_quick
    platform: apprise
    url: tgram://123456789:ABCDefghIJKLmnOPqrstUVwxyz
```

To notify multiple services, pass them as a list:

```yaml
# /config/configuration.yaml
notify:
  - name: apprise_quick
    platform: apprise
    url:
      - tgram://123456789:ABCDefghIJKLmnOPqrstUVwxyz
      - mailtos://user:pass@smtp.gmail.com
```

:::note[No selective targeting with `url`]
Every service listed under `url` fires together on every notification call. If you need to send different alerts to different services, use Method 2 or 3 instead — those support tag-based targeting via the `target` field.
:::


  This method is the standard for managing **multiple** notification services, complex groups, and tagging logic.

Apprise is smart enough to detect your file type. You can use **YAML** (structured) or **TEXT** (simple list) files.

**Step A: Edit `configuration.yaml`**

Point to your preferred configuration file.

```yaml
# /config/configuration.yaml
notify:
  - name: apprise
    platform: apprise
    # You can reference a YAML file...
    config: /config/apprise.yaml

    # ...OR a simple text file
    # config: /config/apprise.conf
```

**Step B: Create your config file**


Create `/config/apprise.yaml`.  Best for complex setups.

```yaml
# /config/apprise.yaml
urls:
  - tgram://123456789:ABCDefghIJKLmnOPqrstUVwxyz:
      tag: telegram
  - mailtos://user:pass@smtp.gmail.com:
      tag: mail
```

:::tip[Hybrid Configuration]
You can also use the `include` directive inside your local file to pull in remote configurations while keeping some local!

```yaml
# /config/apprise.yaml

# Point to an Apprise API Instance:
include http://apprise.host/get/my-profile-key

urls:
  # Plus local overrides
  - mailtos://local-user@example.com
```

:::


Create `/config/apprise.conf`. Best for simple lists of URLs.

```bash
# /config/apprise.conf

# Tag defined by comma prefix
telegram=tgram://123456789:ABCDefghIJKLmnOPqrstUVwxyz

# Multiple tags defined by comma
mail,devops=mailtos://user:pass@smtp.gmail.com
```

:::tip[Hybrid Configuration]
You can also use the `include` directive inside your local file to pull in remote configurations while keeping some local!

```bash
# /config/apprise.conf

# Point to an Apprise API Instance:
include http://apprise.host/get/my-profile-key

# Plus local overrides
mailtos://local-user@example.com
```

:::


:::note
The `include` will only works if your Apprise API server has `APPRISE_CONFIG_LOCK` is not set to `yes`.
:::


This method is ideal for **Roaming Configurations**. If you run multiple Home Assistant instances or other services, you can centralize all your notification logic in a self-hosted [Apprise API](/api/) instance.

**Edit `configuration.yaml`**

Instead of pointing to a local file, point the `config` parameter directly to your API endpoint.

```yaml
# /config/configuration.yaml
notify:
  - name: apprise_api
    platform: apprise
    # Apprise will fetch the configuration from this URL
    config: https://apprise.host/get/my-profile-key
```

:::caution[Access Restriction]
If your Apprise API server is running with `APPRISE_CONFIG_LOCK` enabled, then this method will not work.

## 3. Usage in Automations

Once configured and Home Assistant is restarted, you can send notifications using the `notify` service.

### Example: Using Method 1 (Inline)

If you used **Method 1**, your service is likely named `notify.apprise_quick`. You do not need to provide a `target` because the destination is hardcoded in your configuration.

```yaml
- alias: "[Interactive] - Sunset Notice"
  trigger:
    platform: sun
    event: sunset

  action:
    # Matches the 'name' you gave in configuration.yaml
    service: notify.apprise_quick
    data:
      title: "Good evening"
      message: "The sun is setting."
```

### Example: Using Methods 2 & 3 (Config Based)

If you used **Method 2** or **Method 3**, you can control exactly who gets notified by using the `target` field to match the tags defined in your YAML file (or API configuration).

```yaml
- alias: "[Interactive] - Sunset Notice"
  trigger:
    platform: sun
    event: sunset

  action:
    service: notify.apprise
    data:
      # This 'target' matches the 'tag' in your config
      target: email
      title: "Good evening"
      message: "The sun is setting."
```

### Advanced Tagging Logic

You can combine tags in your `target` field to create powerful notification groups on the fly.

| Target Value              | Logic      | Description                                         |
| :------------------------ | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `target: devops`          | **Simple** | Notifies everything tagged `devops`.                |
| `target: [devops, alarm]` | **OR**     | Notifies everything tagged `devops` **OR** `alarm`. |
| `target: "devops alarm"`  | **AND**    | Notifies only services that have **BOTH** tags.     |

## 4. Testing Your Configuration

Before wiring Apprise into automations, verify it works from the
command line:

```bash
apprise -vv -t "Test" -b "Hello from the CLI" \
    tgram://YOUR_BOT_TOKEN/YOUR_CHAT_ID
```

Then confirm Home Assistant can reach the same service by triggering
the `notify.apprise` service manually from **Developer Tools →
Services**.

## 5. Discovering Available Notify Services

If you want Apprise to call back into Home Assistant itself (for
example, to push to a mobile device registered in the HA companion
app), you can use the `hassio://` plugin in your Apprise URLs. To find
the exact service name:

1. In Home Assistant, open **Developer Tools → Services**.
2. Filter by domain **notify** — you will see entries like
   `notify.mobile_app_johns_phone`.
3. The portion after `notify.` is the service name to use in the
   Apprise URL:

```bash
apprise -vv -t "Alert" -b "Test push" \
    'hassio://ha.local/YOUR_TOKEN/notify.mobile_app_johns_phone'
```

See the [Home Assistant service plugin](/services/homeassistant/) for
the full `hassio://` URL reference.

## 6. Debugging & Logging

If your notifications aren't sending, you can enable debug logging specifically for the Apprise component in Home Assistant. Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.apprise: debug
```

After restarting, check your Home Assistant logs. You will see Apprise attempting to load your configuration and dispatch messages, which will help identify invalid URLs or network issues.
