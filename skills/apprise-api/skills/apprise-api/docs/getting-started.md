The name **Apprise** (/əˈpraɪz/) is pronounced like "uh-prise", similar to _surprise_ or _arise_, with emphasis on the second syllable.

**Apprise** is a notification router. You describe each destination as a URL, hand Apprise a message, and it delivers to every destination you listed.

    media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
  />

It does not replace your chat platform, email provider, or alerting system. It sits in front of them, so you only have to learn one way to send a message.

Whether you run cron jobs, manage containers, or build applications, Apprise saves you from learning and maintaining a different API for every service.

## One Syntax to Rule Them All

At the core of Apprise is the **Universal Notification URL**.

Instead of learning a unique payload format for every service, you configure destinations using a single, predictable syntax:

```text
service://credentials/direction/?parameter=value
```

Switching services later means changing the URL, not your code or your scripts.

This makes notifications portable, maintainable, and easy to reason about.

## How Apprise Fits Together

<picture class="apprise-flow">
  <source
    srcset="/assets/apprise-overview-en-dark.svg"
    media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
  />
  <img
    src="/assets/apprise-overview-en-light.svg"
    alt="Sources on the left send through the Apprise API or core library in the middle, which deliver to notification services on the right."
    loading="lazy"
  />

- **Something needs to send a message.** A script, a webhook, the command line, the mobile app, or software that already speaks Apprise.
- **Apprise handles the delivery.** You either import the Python library into your own code, or run the API server as a shared gateway that anything can post to.
- **The message goes out.** A single request can reach one destination or every destination you have configured, in parallel.

Because the URL format is the same everywhere, a URL you test on the command line works unchanged in a script, in the API server, or on your phone.

## What It Looks Like

From a script or the command line:

```bash
apprise -t "Backup Complete" -b "The server is safe" \
  "discord://webhook_id/webhook_token"
```

Or from your own Python code:

```python
import apprise

apobj = apprise.Apprise()
apobj.add("tgram://credentials")

apobj.notify(
    body="Hello World",
    title="My Notification",
)
```

Both send the same notification. Point them at a different service and only the URL changes.

## Key Features

- **{/_ SERVICES:COUNT _/} supported services**, from popular chat platforms to specialized gateways
- **Format-aware delivery**, including Markdown, HTML, and plain text
- **Attachment support**, automatically adapted to each service's capabilities
- **High performance**, with parallel notification delivery
- **Minimal dependencies**, designed to stay lightweight
