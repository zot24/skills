The Apprise CLI (`apprise`) is a lightweight command-line tool that allows you to send notifications to virtually any service directly from your terminal. It is ideal for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and automation scripts.

## Installing the CLI

The `apprise` command is included with the Apprise core installation.

Most users install it via `pip install apprise`.

Docker images primarily target the **Apprise API**, though the CLI is available inside the container for operational use.

For full installation options, see [Installation](/getting-started/installation/).

## Basic Usage

The syntax is designed to be intuitive. You simply provide the notification details and the destination URLs.

```bash
# General Syntax
apprise -t "Title" -b "Body" "service-url://..."
```

### Sending a Simple Notification

To send a notification, provide a title (`-t`) and a body (`-b`), followed by one or more Apprise URLs.

```bash
# Send a notification to Discord
apprise -t "Task Complete" -b " The backup finished successfully." \
    "discord://webhook_id/webhook_token"
```

### Chaining Multiple Services

You can notify multiple services at once by listing them sequentially. By default,
Apprise sends notifications asynchronously for better performance.

Use `--disable-async` to send notifications synchronously, processing each service
one at a time in the order they are loaded.

```bash
# Notify Discord and Email simultaneously
apprise -vv -t "Server Alert" -b "High CPU usage detected." \
   -n "warning" \
   "discord://webhook_id/webhook_token" \
   "mailto://user:pass@gmail.com"
```

:::tip
Adding `-v` (verbose) is useful for debugging. It prints delivery status and
diagnostic information to the console. Verbosity increases with each additional
`v` (for example `-vv`, `-vvv`), with higher levels producing more detailed output.
:::

## Piping Input (stdin)

The CLI works seamlessly with standard input (`stdin`). If you do not specify a body (`-b`), Apprise listens for input from the pipe. This makes it perfect for monitoring logs or capturing command output.

```bash
# Send the contents of a file
cat /proc/cpuinfo | apprise -t "CPU Info" \
   "mailto://user:pass@gmail.com"

# Send the result of a command
uptime | apprise "discord://webhook_id/webhook_token"
```

## Loading Configuration

While you can pass URLs directly to the command, it is often cleaner to use a configuration file. This keeps secrets out of your command history and allows you to manage complex notification groups.

```bash
# Load configuration from a file and send a message
apprise --config "/etc/apprise/config.yml" \
    --body "System is going down for maintenance"
```

For more details on how to structure your configuration files, see the [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration/) guide.
