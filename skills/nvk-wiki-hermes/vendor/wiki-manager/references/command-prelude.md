Every `/wiki:*` command starts with the same handful of steps: resolve the hub path, figure out which wiki to use, and decide what to do if no wiki exists. This file is the canonical version of those steps so each command can reference it instead of restating it.

## Why this file exists

The prelude appeared verbatim in 14 command files. Every time the hub resolution protocol changed, it had to be edited in every command. That's a drift trap and an LLM token tax. As of v0.4.1, the steps are inlined in each command file for reliability, but this file remains as the canonical reference for the protocol design.

## Standard prelude

**IMPORTANT: Hub resolution is 1-2 file reads, not an exploration task. Do NOT launch Explore agents, run `find` commands, or search the filesystem. Just read the files below in order.**

Every command that needs a wiki follows these steps in order:

1. **Resolve HUB.** Follow the protocol in [`hub-resolution.md`](hub-resolution.md). Short version: read `~/.config/llm-wiki/config.json` (expand `~` to `$HOME`). Prefer `hub_path`, expanding only the leading `~` on the current machine. Treat `resolved_path` as a legacy fallback cache, not the source of truth; use it only when no `hub_path` exists or when the expanded `hub_path` is unavailable and `resolved_path` is initialized. If no config exists, try `$HOME/wiki/_index.md` as fallback. If the configured path can be statted but reading `wikis.json` or listing `topics/` fails with `Operation not permitted`, stop: this is a macOS/iCloud privacy denial, not a missing path. Tell the user to grant access to the exact launcher and restart; do not fall back to `~/wiki` or `resolved_path`.

2. **Resolve wiki location.** The target wiki is determined by this order (first match wins):
   1. `--local` flag → `.wiki/` in the current directory
   2. `--wiki <name>` flag → look up in `HUB/wikis.json`, resolving `<HUB>`, `~`, absolute, and HUB-relative paths; if a registry path is stale, fall back to `HUB/topics/<name>`. If the registry entry has `status: archived` or resolves under `topics/.archive/`, commands that read/write semantic content should reject it unless they explicitly support archived inclusion.
   3. Current directory contains a `.wiki/` → use it
   4. Otherwise → HUB (use the hub's active topic wiki, or fail per the command's wiki-requirement variant below)

3. **Verify existence.** Try to read `<wiki-root>/_index.md`. If missing, follow the command's wiki-requirement variant below.

4. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS`.** Each command defines its own flags; parse them after the wiki is resolved so flag validation can use wiki state (for example, `--project <slug>` checking whether the project exists).

## Wiki-requirement variants

Commands differ in what they do when no wiki is found. Each command picks one of these variants and states it in its task section.

### Variant A: wiki-required (most read/write commands)

If no wiki exists, stop with:

> No wiki found. Run `/wiki init <topic>` first.

Commands using this variant: `compile`, `lint`, `query`, `output`, `plan`, `retract`, `assess`. The rationale is correctness — running these on an empty state would silently produce nothing or corrupt derived caches.

### Variant B: wiki-creating (ingest, research, thesis)

These commands accept `--new-topic <name>` (or equivalent) and will create a topic wiki on the fly when the flag is set. When `--new-topic` is **not** set and no wiki is found, they stop with:

> No wiki found. Use `--new-topic <name>` to create one, or run `/wiki init` first.

The rationale is ergonomics — research and ingestion are often the first operation on a new subject, so forcing a separate `init` step doubles the friction. `--new-topic` is explicit opt-in to creation so the default path still errs cautiously.

### Variant C: wiki-neutral (project, output without articles, status)

These commands either don't require wiki content (project manifest operations, wiki status) or have their own "no articles yet" message. They resolve HUB and wiki location, then handle missing state inline with command-specific messaging.

### Variant D: hub lifecycle (archive)

Archive resolves HUB, not an active topic wiki. It mutates topic lifecycle by
moving topic roots between `HUB/topics/<slug>/` and
`HUB/topics/.archive/<slug>/`, then updating `wikis.json`. It does not operate
on project-local `.wiki/` directories in v1.

### Variant E: hub specialist library (specialist)

Specialist management resolves HUB and reads its `_index.md`, `wikis.json`,
and optional `.skills/_index.md`. Resolve one active topic only for
enable/disable, applying a method, or a targeted candidate scan. Specialist
definitions remain at hub scope and are never copied into topic content.

## Archive visibility

Archived topic wikis are quiet by default. Normal query, compile, ingest,
research, output, plan, assess, librarian, refresh, and broad audit workflows
skip registry entries with `status: archived` or paths under `topics/.archive/`.
Deep query may report archived index matches separately, but full archived reads
require explicit user intent such as `--include-archived`.

## Project scoping

Commands that accept `--project <slug>` (`ingest`, `research`, `output`, `compile`) apply it as an explicit flag only. There is no ambient project focus — earlier iterations of this plugin had a `.wiki-session.json` focus mechanism that made project scope sticky, but it was removed in the v0.2 projects simplification. The rationale is documented in [`projects.md`](projects.md) § "Focus": one explicit flag per command is simpler than a whole session-state mechanism, and if a user finds themselves typing `--project foo` on every invocation that's a signal to `cd` into the project folder directly.

## What commands still handle inline

Anything command-specific stays in the command file:

- `### Parse $ARGUMENTS` sections (flag docs)
- Command-specific deviations from the 4-step wiki resolution (e.g., `assess` asks which wiki to compare against when none is specified, `thesis` has its own `--new-topic`-equivalent branching in Phase 1)
- Per-command `--project` behavior details (which commands support it and how they scope outputs)
- The command's actual work (the reason the command exists)

## When to edit this file

Edit `command-prelude.md` when:

- The hub resolution protocol changes (e.g., new config location, new fallback path)
- The wiki resolution order changes (e.g., a new flag like `--wiki` or `--local` is added)
- A new wiki-requirement variant is introduced (e.g., a command that wants to lazy-create a wiki on write)
- The explicit project-scoping rules change

Do **not** edit this file for command-specific changes. Those stay in the command.
