# Inventory Reference

Inventory is a wiki-owned tracking layer for durable "things we care about" that
are not necessarily raw sources, compiled articles, or output artifacts. It is
for physical or digital items, Ideas, ingest candidates, entities, corpora,
open questions, recurring tasks, watch items, and other records the user wants
the wiki to remember and revisit.

Inventory records are markdown files with frontmatter. They can cite `raw/`,
`wiki/`, `datasets/`, `output/`, URLs, or external paths, but they do not move
or copy those artifacts.

Local `sources:` paths and body links in inventory records should resolve.
Lint checks them as provenance for tracking state, not as evidence for factual
claims.

## Fit Check

Inventory is opinionated. Before creating records or proposing a migration, say
why the thing does or does not belong in inventory.

Good fits:

- The user wants the wiki to remember something across sessions.
- The item has state, priority, owner, next action, or a follow-up date.
- The item is a real object, SKU, part, host, tool, asset, or component whose
  owned/wanted/selected/rejected state should be listed and revisited.
- The item is a candidate source/corpus/entity/question that may be acted on
  later, but is not ready to ingest, compile, or turn into an output.
- The item is an Idea that should be researched and shaped before the user
  commits it to a Project. Use the dedicated Ideas workflow for these records.
- The item needs to be listed, filtered, revisited, or linked from datasets,
  research sessions, audits, or plans.

Too small for inventory:

- A one-off URL/file/text the user wants ingested now. Use `raw/` via ingest.
- A factual question with no durable follow-up. Answer with query/research.
- A single note with no status or future action. Keep it as a raw note or reply
  in chat.
- A tiny ad hoc to-do that does not belong to the wiki's topic scope.

Too big for inventory:

- Hundreds or thousands of row-like items. Use `datasets/` for large/external
  data or `ingest-collection` for bounded source collections.
- A queue whose rows are really dataset records, messages, transactions,
  captures, or pages. Track one corpus inventory record and point it at the
  dataset manifest or collection manifest.
- Anything that would require opening every record body just to list it. Promote
  the underlying collection to a dataset or collection ingest and keep inventory
  as a small tracking layer.

Out of scope:

- Authoritative source text. That belongs in `raw/`.
- Synthesized knowledge. That belongs in `wiki/`.
- Generated deliverables. Those belong in `output/`.
- Project rationale and membership. Those belong under `output/projects/`.
- Secrets, credentials, private personal data, or operational state that should
  not be copied into the wiki.

When the fit is marginal, be direct: "This is probably too small for inventory;
I would ingest it as a raw note instead." or "This is too large for inventory;
I would create one corpus record plus a dataset manifest." Do not make the user
infer the boundary.

## Preview Before Pivots

For larger pivots, show a sample before asking for confirmation. This applies
when migrating output artifacts, converting many wiki notes into inventory
records, or creating more than a handful of records.

Preview format:

```markdown
Suggested inventory shape:

| Proposed Record | Kind | Status | Priority | Source | Next Action |
|-----------------|------|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Bitcointalk Archive | corpus | proposed | p1 | output/... | Profile archive and decide dataset manifest. |

Recommendation: create 1 corpus record and 1 dataset manifest, not 200
inventory records. Apply this migration?
```

Default to dry-run previews for pivots. Only write records when the user
explicitly asks to apply, or when they asked for a single small `add` operation
with clear fields.

## Directory Layout

Inventory lives at the wiki root and is created lazily. A wiki with no
`inventory/` directory has no inventory records yet; read-only commands should
report that state without creating files. Write commands create the root and
only the category directory they need.

```text
inventory/
├── _index.md
├── items/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
├── ideas/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
├── candidates/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
├── entities/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
├── corpora/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
└── views/
    ├── _index.md
    └── *.md
```

The subdirectories are intentionally broad:

- `items/`: physical or digital inventory items such as parts, tools, hosts,
  products, SKUs, subscriptions, and owned/wanted/rejected assets.
- `ideas/`: possible products, experiments, publications, decisions, or other
  deliverables being researched and shaped before Project commitment. See
  [ideas.md](ideas.md).
- `candidates/`: ingest candidates, open questions, tasks, watch items, and
  proposed follow-up work.
- `entities/`: people, organizations, projects, venues, standards bodies, or
  other named things worth tracking.
- `corpora/`: source collections, archives, datasets, forums, document sets, or
  other bounded bodies of material.
- `views/`: generated inventory views such as "P0 blocked candidates" or
  "active corpora by license." Views are derived and may be regenerated.
  Created only when a saved view is written.

## Chat And Saved Views

Inventory needs to be useful in a chat session before it is useful as files on
disk. Default to efficient, readable list/table views instead of dumping full
records.

### Chat View Rules

- Read `inventory/_index.md` and subdirectory indexes first.
- Use record frontmatter for filtering and sorting. Do not open every record
  body just to answer "list inventory."
- Default chat output is a compact Markdown table. Keep columns narrow and
  action-oriented.
- If there are more than about 12 rows, show the highest-priority or most
  recently updated rows first, then report how many rows were omitted and where
  the full index lives.
- Use bullets instead of a table when long URLs, paths, or prose next actions
  would make a table unreadable.
- Open full records only when the user asks for detail or when requested columns
  are not present in the indexes/frontmatter.

Recommended chat views:

| View | Columns | Use |
|------|---------|-----|
| `summary` | counts by kind/status, top priorities | quick status checks |
| `actions` | title, priority, status, next action, updated | planning the next work |
| `items` | item, status, priority, quantity, next action, updated | actual inventory checks |
| `ideas` | idea, topic, status, derived maturity, priority, next action | Idea catalog and shaping queue |
| `records` | title, kind, status, priority, updated | complete compact inventory |
| `sources` | title, source/origin pointers, status | provenance and migration review |

### Saved Views

When the user wants a reusable view, save it under `inventory/views/`. View files
are derived markdown views, not inventory records. They may be regenerated from
record frontmatter and should not be treated as authoritative state.

Suggested view frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Active Inventory Actions"
view: actions
filters:
  status: active
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
summary: "Derived table of active inventory records with next actions."
---
```

Suggested body:

```markdown
# Active Inventory Actions

Generated from inventory record frontmatter on YYYY-MM-DD.

| Record | Kind | Priority | Next Action | Updated |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
```

Saved views should link to records rather than duplicate long record bodies.
If a view starts needing hundreds or thousands of rows, promote the underlying
collection to a dataset manifest and keep the view as a small summary.

## Record Format

```markdown
---
title: "Bitcointalk Schnoering Figshare Dataset"
kind: corpus
status: proposed
priority: p0
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
last_checked: YYYY-MM-DD
next_action: "Profile archive contents and decide dataset registry location."
sources:
  - output/bitcointalk-data-2026-05-03.md
  - https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/BitcoinTemporalGraph/26305093
tags: [bitcointalk, dataset, ingest-candidate]
confidence: medium
summary: "Large Bitcointalk corpus candidate identified during research."

# Bitcointalk Schnoering Figshare Dataset

## Why Track This

...

## Current State

...

## Next Action

## Notes

...
```

Required fields:

- `title`
- `kind`
- `status`
- `priority`
- `created`
- `updated`
- `tags`
- `summary`

Recommended fields:

- `last_checked`
- `next_action`
- `sources`
- `confidence`
- `origin` for migrated records
- `owner` if a human or project owns the next action

Kinds:

- `item`
- `idea`
- `ingest-candidate`
- `entity`
- `corpus`
- `question`
- `task`
- `artifact`
- `watch`

For `kind: item`, use optional fields when they help list or filter the record:

- `category`: domain-specific group such as `drivetrain`, `hardware`, `host`, or
  `subscription`
- `quantity`: owned or target quantity when known
- `unit`: unit for `quantity` when useful
- `state`: domain-specific state such as `owned`, `wanted`, `selected`,
  `rejected`, `spare`, or `unknown`
- `default_choice`: preferred SKU, part, tool, host, or option
- `alternatives`: short list of acceptable replacements
- `needed_for`: build, project, host role, or workflow that needs the item

For `kind: idea`, use the dedicated record body, maturity derivation, duplicate
checks, research/shaping workflow, and explicit promotion contract in
[ideas.md](ideas.md). Ideas use `inventory/ideas/`, not `candidates/`.

Statuses:

- `proposed`: discovered, not accepted yet
- `active`: accepted and being tracked
- `blocked`: cannot proceed until a dependency is resolved
- `ingested`: completed as a raw/wiki ingest or equivalent action
- `superseded`: replaced by a better record/source
- `archived`: no longer active but retained for history

Priorities:

- `p0`: highest leverage or urgent
- `p1`: important
- `p2`: useful
- `p3`: low priority
- `p4`: keep for completeness

## Index Format

`inventory/_index.md` should summarize counts and link to category indexes:

```markdown
# Inventory Index

> Durable tracking records for items, Ideas, candidates, entities, corpora, and watch items.

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Statistics

- Total records: N
- Items: N
- Ideas: N
- Candidates: N
- Entities: N
- Corpora: N
- Active: N
- Blocked: N

## Quick Navigation

- [Items](items/_index.md)
- [Ideas](ideas/_index.md)
- [Candidates](candidates/_index.md)
- [Entities](entities/_index.md)
- [Corpora](corpora/_index.md)
- [Views](views/_index.md)

## Contents

| File | Kind | Status | Priority | Next Action | Updated |
|------|------|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
```

Subdirectory indexes use the same table shape. Indexes are derived caches; the
frontmatter in inventory record files is authoritative.

`inventory/views/_index.md` may use the standard file/summary/tags/updated table
for saved views. View files are derived from record frontmatter; they are not
required to have `kind`, `status`, or `priority`.

## Migration Paths

Inventory migration is explicit and additive. Do not move or delete existing
outputs during migration.

### Discovery

`inventory scan-outputs` looks for output files that are really durable tracking
records:

- filenames containing `queue`, `backlog`, `inventory`, `candidate`, `watch`,
  `sources`, `corpus`, `dataset`, `parts`, `skus`, `gear`, or `assets`
- titles containing those terms
- tables with URL/source/status/priority/next-action columns, or part/SKU/
  quantity/default/alternative columns

It reports suggested `inventory migrate-output ... --apply` commands. It must
not write inventory files.

### Output Migration

`inventory migrate-output <path>` defaults to dry-run. It reads the output and
proposes one or more inventory records with:

- `origin: output/...`
- `sources:` pointing at the original output and any cited URLs/files
- inferred `kind`, `status`, and `priority`
- body sections preserving useful rationale and next actions

`--apply` writes new inventory records but still leaves the original output in
place. Cleanup of legacy outputs is a later human decision.

## Lint Behavior

Lint should treat missing `inventory/` as a migration opportunity for older
wikis, not as corruption:

- Missing `inventory/` on an existing wiki: suggestion, not critical.
- `lint --fix`: may repair indexes for an inventory layer that already exists,
  but should not create a completely absent `inventory/` tree just to populate
  empty placeholders.
- Output files that look like inventory: suggestion with migration commands.
- Lint must never auto-convert output artifacts into inventory records.

## Relationship To Other Layers

- `raw/`: immutable ingested source content. If an inventory candidate is
  ingested, link the raw source from the inventory record and move status toward
  `ingested` only after the user accepts that the tracking item is complete.
- `wiki/`: synthesized knowledge articles. Inventory records are not evidence
  for factual claims; they are operational state. Query and compile may mention
  them as gaps, candidates, or next actions, but should not cite them as sources
  for article facts.
- `datasets/`: manifests and query interfaces for large/external data. Large
  corpora should usually have one inventory record explaining why they matter
  plus one dataset manifest explaining where and how the data is accessed.
- `output/`: generated deliverables. Outputs that become durable queues,
  backlogs, watch lists, or source-candidate tables should be migrated
  additively through an inventory dry run, not edited in place.
- `research`: may seed searches from active inventory records and may propose
  new records for important unresolved gaps, but should not create a backlog for
  every minor curiosity.
- `audit`, `librarian`, and `refresh`: may surface stale, blocked, or
  high-priority follow-ups as inventory candidates when the issue needs to
  persist beyond the current report.
- `plan` and `project`: may link to inventory records for work queues and
  dependencies, but project goals stay in `WHY.md`.
- `idea`: uses a specialized inventory record to develop a proposal and may
  explicitly promote its approved snapshot into a linked Project.
- `lint`: repairs indexes for an inventory layer that already exists and
  reports migration candidates; it never creates a blank optional layer, decides
  a pivot, or writes records without the explicit inventory migration workflow.
- `inventory/`: durable tracking records and next-action state.

Inventory records can point at the other layers, but they do not replace them.
