# Private Adapter Protocol

## Purpose

Private adapters let llm-wiki invoke locally installed research tools without
publishing their source code, credentials, corpora, or generated bulk data.
The public llm-wiki project defines the `llm-wiki-adapter/v1` control-plane
contract; adapter implementations remain in their own local or private repos.

An adapter repository is always a **tool-only, content-free code plane**. It
may contain executable code, manifests, schemas, documentation, tests, and
synthetic fixtures generated in temporary test directories. It must never
contain real source content, source-specific case configuration, corpora,
captures, documents, recordings, transcripts, indexes, credentials, generated
results, evidence packets, or source-specific identifiers. Private visibility
is defense in depth, not permission to mix code and content.

This is separate from `ingest-collection --adapter`. Collection adapters are
agent instructions for known upstream formats. Private adapters are explicitly
registered executables with a machine-local trust and path policy.

The control plane can also govern remote side effects. Remote resources must be
registered exactly, every operation declares `remote-read` and/or
`remote-write`, and remote writes require an approved plan hash, expected
revision, stable idempotency key, private response receipt, and adapter-supplied
read-back verification. These controls authorize a bounded operation; they do
not make the adapter process an operating-system sandbox.

## Registry

Registrations live at:

```text
~/.config/llm-wiki/adapters.json
```

The registry is machine-local, mode `0600`, and never belongs in `wikis.json`,
the hub, a topic wiki, session context, or a public repository. It stores local
paths, argv arrays, declared capabilities, allowed environment-variable names,
local read/write roots, and exact remote resource identifiers. It never stores
environment-variable values. Normal `adapter list` output reports only the
remote-resource count; `adapter show` exposes the exact machine-local policy.

Registration is explicit and local. llm-wiki does not clone, install, update,
publish, or mirror adapter repositories.

## Repository naming

Private adapter repositories use the prefix convention:

```text
llm-wiki-adapter-<domain>-<capability>
```

The manifest id is the stable lowercase kebab-case portion after the prefix:

```text
<domain>-<capability>
```

For example, repository `llm-wiki-adapter-x-community-intelligence` declares
manifest id `x-community-intelligence`. Do not put `private`, an owner name, or
a version in either name. Reserve `intelligence` for substantive analysis;
use narrower terms such as `sync`, `indexing`, `validation`, or
`transcription` when they describe the tool more accurately. Content
repositories remain separately named, for example `bitcoin-wiki`.

## Locate the bundled CLI

Use the bundled `bin/llm-wiki` from the installed plugin root. Claude exposes
`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`; Codex supplies the installed skill path, whose plugin
root is two directories above `skills/wiki/SKILL.md`; OpenCode uses its loaded
plugin path. In a source checkout, use `scripts/llm-wiki`.

Do not assume a globally installed `llm-wiki` executable. In examples below,
`LLM_WIKI` means the resolved bundled or source-checkout executable.

## Intent routing

Route by the requested effect and target before applying normal wiki URL
rules. A URL is not automatically an ingestion request when the user is asking
an external tool to act on that resource. Normalize the requested effect to a
lowercase intent token, then ask the registry before ingestion:

```bash
$LLM_WIKI adapter route --intent edit --resource '<external-url>' --json
```

A `matched` result identifies the trusted adapter and an adapter-owned workflow
guide. Read that guide, run `adapter doctor <id>`, and follow only its bounded
workflow. Provider authentication, browser setup, planning constraints,
recovery, and verification belong in the private adapter guide, not in the
public wiki plugin. A `no-match` result permits normal routing. `ambiguous` or
`unavailable` fails closed until the registrations are repaired.

Route lookup never echoes the resource. A URL without a concrete requested
effect is not write authorization, and a bounded instruction authorizes only a
faithful plan. All generic remote-write controls below still apply regardless
of provider.

## Adapter manifest

Every adapter root contains `.llm-wiki-adapter.json`:

```json
{
  "protocol": "llm-wiki-adapter/v1",
  "id": "example-analysis",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "distribution": "private",
  "entrypoint": [".venv/bin/python", "-m", "example.adapter"],
  "capabilities": ["corpus-validation", "analysis"],
  "routes": [
    {
      "id": "edit-hosted-document",
      "intents": ["edit", "revise", "update"],
      "resource": {
        "kind": "url",
        "schemes": ["https"],
        "hosts": ["editor.example.invalid"],
        "path_prefixes": ["/document/"]
      },
      "guide": "AGENT_WORKFLOW.md",
      "priority": 50
    }
  ],
  "network": "none",
  "writes_wiki": false,
  "operations": {
    "analyze": {
      "read_arguments": ["case"],
      "requires_output_dir": true
    },
    "apply": {
      "read_arguments": ["plan"],
      "remote_resource_arguments": ["document_resource"],
      "requires_output_dir": true,
      "approved_plan_argument": "plan",
      "effects": ["remote-read", "remote-write"]
    }
  },
  "output_classes": ["wiki-safe", "private", "bulk"]
}
```

The entrypoint must implement:

```text
<entrypoint> describe
<entrypoint> execute --request <json-path> --response <json-path>
```

`describe` prints one JSON object matching the manifest identity, version, and
capabilities. `execute` writes exactly one response document. Diagnostic output
may go to stderr, but llm-wiki does not persist or echo it by default.

`routes` is optional. Each route declares one or more lowercase intent tokens,
an exact URL matcher, a relative adapter-owned Markdown guide, and an integer
priority from 0 to 1000. URL matching supports exact schemes and hosts plus
path prefixes; manifests do not get arbitrary regular expressions. The guide
must exist inside the adapter root. Registrations at the same highest priority
are ambiguous and fail closed rather than choosing by accident.

## Request and response

Request:

```json
{
  "protocol": "llm-wiki-adapter/v1",
  "adapter_id": "example-analysis",
  "operation": "analyze",
  "arguments": {"case": "/absolute/private/case.json"},
  "output_dir": "/absolute/private/results/run-1",
  "options": {}
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "protocol": "llm-wiki-adapter/v1",
  "adapter_id": "example-analysis",
  "adapter_version": "1.0.0",
  "operation": "analyze",
  "status": "ok",
  "run_id": "stable-run-id",
  "summary": {},
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "path": "evidence-packet.json",
      "sha256": "64-lowercase-hex-characters",
      "class": "wiki-safe",
      "media_type": "application/json",
      "role": "evidence-packet"
    }
  ]
}
```

Path arguments declared by the operation must be absolute, must exist, and
must stay inside registered read roots. `output_dir` and every returned
artifact must stay inside registered write roots. Artifact files and SHA-256
values are verified after execution.

### Remote-write request and receipt

Remote resource arguments contain opaque, scheme-prefixed identifiers such as
`hosted-document:<resource-id>`. Every value must exactly match one registered with
`adapter add --remote-resource`; remote-resource identifiers are never inferred
from local files or adapter output.

A remote-write request adds:

```json
{
  "arguments": {
    "document_resource": "hosted-document:<resource-id>",
    "plan": "/absolute/private/plan.json"
  },
  "remote_write": {
    "plan_sha256": "64-lowercase-hex-characters",
    "idempotency_key": "caller-stable-key-0001",
    "expected_revision": "remote-revision-from-plan"
  }
}
```

The CLI hashes the declared `approved_plan_argument` itself. Execution requires
`--approve-remote-write <same-plan-sha256>` and `--response` inside a registered
write root. A successful response must include a matching `remote_receipt` with
the exact resources, plan hash, idempotency key, before/after revisions, and
`verification.status: verified`. The complete mode-0600 response stays private;
terminal JSON is redacted and reports only status and counts.

## Commands

```bash
$LLM_WIKI adapter add /private/adapter \
  --read-root /private/input \
  --write-root /private/results \
  --remote-resource hosted-document:<resource-id>
$LLM_WIKI adapter list
$LLM_WIKI adapter show example-analysis
$LLM_WIKI adapter route --intent edit --resource '<external-url>' --json
$LLM_WIKI adapter doctor example-analysis
$LLM_WIKI adapter run example-analysis --request /private/request.json --json
$LLM_WIKI adapter run example-analysis \
  --request /private/apply-request.json \
  --response /private/results/apply-receipt.json \
  --approve-remote-write <plan-sha256> --json
$LLM_WIKI adapter remove example-analysis --yes
```

`add` trusts an existing checkout but does not fetch it. `doctor` verifies the
manifest hash, executable, and `describe` handshake. Manifest drift blocks
execution until the user explicitly re-registers with `add --replace`.

## Wiki promotion boundary

Adapters never receive a wiki write path and must declare `writes_wiki: false`.
Execution only produces external artifacts and a verified receipt. It never
imports content into `raw/`, `wiki/`, `output/`, inventory, or datasets.
The executable may read authorized external inputs and write authorized
external runtime results, but it does not own, embed, publish, or automatically
surface that content. Inputs and outputs belong to the separately controlled
data plane.
This is a protocol and workflow boundary, not an operating-system sandbox:
explicitly registered adapter code runs with the permissions of its parent
process, so register only code you trust.

After a successful run:

1. inspect only artifacts labeled `wiki-safe`;
2. treat that label as an import candidate, not proof of correctness;
3. review content, provenance, identifiers, and privacy before writing;
4. keep `private` and `bulk` artifacts outside the wiki;
5. create a compact immutable raw note or repository/run note when useful;
6. compile bounded conclusions through the normal workflow; and
7. append the resulting wiki write to topic and hub logs.

Never auto-promote adapter output. Never infer that private repository access
authorizes redistribution, protected-content access, sensitive inference, or
publication of corpus-derived individual data.

## Security properties and limits

- Execution uses an argv array with `shell=False` and a timeout.
- Only a small base environment plus explicitly allowlisted variable names is
  passed; secret values are not stored in the registry.
- Manifest drift, path escape, missing artifacts, and hash mismatch fail closed.
- Remote-resource escape, missing explicit approval, plan-hash mismatch, missing
  idempotency/revision controls, unscoped receipt paths, and unverified remote
  success responses fail closed.
- Adapter code, installation, dependencies, authentication, and updates remain
  the adapter owner's responsibility.
- The outer operating-system sandbox remains the actual enforcement boundary;
  registry scopes are an additional validation layer, not a sandbox escape.
- Network use must be declared as `none`, `optional`, or `required` and still
  requires the runtime's normal network permissions.
