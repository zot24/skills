## Your task

Build a current portfolio view across Ideas and Projects. Read
`skills/wiki-manager/references/portfolio.md`, plus `ideas.md` or `projects.md`
only when their derivation rules are needed.

This operation is read-only. It must not create a `project-ideas` topic, a hub
Ideas/Portfolio directory, saved view, duplicate record, or activity-log entry.

### Resolve scope

Resolve HUB from `$HOME/.config/llm-wiki/config.json`, preferring `hub_path`.

- `--local` selects the current `.wiki/`.
- `--wiki <name>` selects one active topic from `HUB/wikis.json`.
- With neither flag, select every active topic in `HUB/wikis.json`, excluding
  the synthetic `hub` entry.
- Skip archived topics unless `--include-archived` is explicit.

### Build the catalog

For each selected topic:

1. Read its `_index.md`.
2. Read `inventory/ideas/_index.md` when present. Open individual Idea records
   only for missing requested fields, stale-index checks, filters, project
   linkage, or maturity verification.
3. Enumerate active Projects from `output/projects/*/WHY.md`. Read only the
   first heading and first non-heading paragraph by default.
4. Link an Idea and Project only through an explicit resolving `project:` field.
   A linked Project has origin `promoted Idea`; every other Project has origin
   `direct`. Never infer lineage from matching slugs or titles.
5. Apply filters and limits after collecting the compact metadata.

Do not read `raw/`, full Concept/article bodies, loose outputs, or Project
member contents for the ordinary list.

### Report

Show counts followed by separate compact Ideas and Projects tables. Include
topic, canonical link/path, operational state, next action or goal, and explicit
cross-links. State that Concepts are supporting knowledge rather than portfolio
rows and that the result is derived live from topic-owned records.

If the user asks to discover legacy or Concept-derived opportunities, stop
after a 1-3 candidate preview. Do not create bulk Idea records without explicit
approval.
