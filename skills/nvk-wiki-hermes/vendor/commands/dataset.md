## Your task

**Resolve the wiki.** Do NOT broadly search the filesystem — follow these steps:
1. Read `$HOME/.config/llm-wiki/config.json`. If it has `hub_path`, expand leading `~` only (not tildes in `com~apple~CloudDocs`) and prefer that path; use `resolved_path` only as a fallback cache when the expanded `hub_path` is unavailable and `resolved_path` is initialized. If config has only `resolved_path`, use it. If the configured path can be statted but reading `wikis.json` or listing `topics/` fails with `Operation not permitted`, stop and ask the user to grant Full Disk Access/iCloud Drive access to the launcher; do not fall back to `~/wiki` or `resolved_path`. Do not write machine-specific `resolved_path` into shared configs.
2. If no config → read `$HOME/wiki/_index.md`. If it exists → HUB = `$HOME/wiki`. If nothing found, ask the user where to create the wiki.
3. **Wiki location** (first match): `--local` → `.wiki/` in CWD; `--wiki <name>` → `HUB/wikis.json` lookup with portable path resolution (`<HUB>`, `~`, absolute, or HUB-relative); if the registry path is stale, fall back to `HUB/topics/<name>`; CWD has `.wiki/` → use it; else → HUB.
4. Read `<wiki>/_index.md` to verify. If missing → stop with "No wiki found. Run `/wiki init` first."

Archive rule: dataset commands operate on active topic wikis by default. If a
named target is archived, stop and ask the user to restore it or rerun with
`--include-archived`. When explicitly included, list/update manifests only
inside that archived topic path and label the result as archived. This is
separate from dataset manifest `status: archived`.

After resolving the wiki, read the dataset reference at `skills/wiki-manager/references/datasets.md`, then run the requested subcommand.

Dataset manifests are for large or external data that should not be copied into
`raw/` or `wiki/`. The wiki stores pointers, schema notes, small samples,
profiles, query recipes, and provenance. Actual datasets remain at their
original filesystem path, object store, URL, database, or archive.

Be opinionated about whether a dataset manifest is warranted:

- Good fit: large, mutable, remote, compressed, binary, database-backed, or
  query-oriented data that should stay outside markdown.
- Too small: a short CSV/JSON/text file that can be ingested as one immutable
  `raw/data/` source.
- Too operational: a next-action queue about a corpus belongs in inventory,
  with an optional link to a dataset manifest.
- Too broad: many independent sources/pages should usually be
  `ingest-collection`, not a dataset manifest.

Before larger pivots, preview the shape: one dataset manifest plus any linked
inventory record, sample/profile/query notes, and what data will remain
external. Do not ask the user to approve a big migration without showing this
sample.

### Parse $ARGUMENTS

Subcommands:

- **list**: List dataset manifests, optionally filtered by status/storage and view mode.
- **add "<title>"**: Create a dataset manifest under `datasets/<slug>/`.
- **show <slug-or-path>**: Read one dataset manifest and related profile/sample indexes.
- **scan-outputs [--dry-run]**: Find output artifacts that describe datasets but still live in `output/`.
- **migrate-output <output-path> [--dry-run|--apply]**: Convert one legacy output artifact into one or more dataset manifests. Default is **dry-run**. `--apply` is required to write.
- **profile <slug> [--dry-run|--apply]**: Record lightweight dataset size/format/schema observations. Never load the full dataset into the wiki.
- **sample <slug> [--limit N] [--dry-run|--apply]**: Save a tiny representative sample or sample recipe under the dataset folder.

Statuses:
`proposed`, `active`, `external`, `archived`, `unavailable`.

Storage modes:
`local`, `remote`, `external`, `hybrid`.

Schema statuses:
`unknown`, `inferred`, `declared`, `validated`.

Archive flag:
`--include-archived` explicitly allows the selected wiki itself to be archived.

### Ensure Structure

Dataset structure is lazy. Do not create it during read-only operations, and do
not create empty sample/profile/query folders until the relevant command needs
them.

Before a write:

1. Ensure `datasets/` exists with `_index.md`.
2. For a manifest write, ensure `datasets/<slug>/` exists with `_index.md`.
3. For `profile`, ensure `datasets/<slug>/profiles/_index.md`.
4. For `sample`, ensure `datasets/<slug>/samples/_index.md`.
5. For query recipes, ensure `datasets/<slug>/queries/_index.md`.
6. Missing structure may be created, but never move or copy user datasets into the wiki.

### Add

1. Slugify the title using normal wiki filename rules.
2. Create `datasets/<slug>/` with `_index.md`. Do not create `samples/`,
   `profiles/`, or `queries/` yet unless the user is also writing one of those
   notes now.
3. Write `MANIFEST.md` with frontmatter per `references/datasets.md`.
4. Record any `--location`, `--format`, size, access, license, or source hints provided by the user.
5. Append to `log.md`:
   `## [YYYY-MM-DD] dataset | added <slug>`
6. Rebuild `datasets/_index.md`.

### List

1. If `datasets/` or `datasets/_index.md` is missing, report that there are no
   dataset manifests yet and do not create files.
2. Read `datasets/_index.md` first.
3. If filters require fields not present in the index, read only
   `datasets/*/MANIFEST.md` frontmatter. Do not inspect samples, profiles,
   queries, or underlying data for a list operation.
4. Present a compact chat-friendly result. Default to a Markdown table with
   dataset, status, storage, formats, size, records, schema status, and updated
   date.
5. Use `--view` to choose columns:
   - `summary`: counts by status/storage plus the most actionable manifests
   - `manifests`: one row per manifest
   - `schema`: schema status, formats, record count, profile availability
   - `locations`: compact storage/access/location pointers
6. Use `--format list` for short bullets when paths or URLs would make a table
   unreadable. Use `--limit N` to cap rows in chat and report the hidden count.

### Scan Outputs

This is the migration discovery path. It must not write dataset manifests.

1. Scan `output/**/*.md`, excluding `_index.md` and `output/projects/*/WHY.md`.
2. Flag artifacts that look like dataset descriptions:
   - filenames or titles containing `dataset`, `data`, `corpus`, `archive`, `dump`, `warehouse`, `lake`, `parquet`, `sqlite`, `duckdb`, `csv`, `jsonl`, or `snapshot`
   - bodies with fields/tables for size, rows, schema, license, storage path, query recipes, or sample excerpts
3. Suggest a `dataset migrate-output <path> --dry-run` command for each candidate.
4. For strong candidates, show a small sample shape: manifest slug, status,
   storage, locations, schema status, and whether an inventory record should be
   linked for next actions.
5. Report: "No dataset manifests were created. Run `dataset migrate-output <path> --apply` to create manifests."

### Migrate Output

Default mode is dry-run. This creates a migration plan only:

1. Read the output artifact.
2. Infer one or more dataset manifests.
3. Preserve the original output path in frontmatter as `origin: output/...`.
4. Preserve any cited data locations in `locations:`.
5. Do **not** move or delete the source output.
6. Do **not** copy the underlying dataset into the wiki.
7. In dry-run, show proposed manifest paths and frontmatter only. If the output
   is mostly an operational queue, recommend inventory instead; if it is a
   source collection, recommend `ingest-collection`.
8. With `--apply`, write proposed manifests, update indexes, and append to `log.md`:
   `## [YYYY-MM-DD] dataset | migrated <output-path> -> N manifests`

### Profile

Profiling is intentionally lightweight:

1. Read the manifest and resolve `locations:`.
2. If a location is local and safely accessible, collect only metadata:
   - byte size via `du` or `stat`
   - file type via extension or `file`
   - first line/header for text tabular data
   - row count only if cheap and bounded
3. For remote locations, record planned profile steps instead of fetching large data.
4. Dry-run by default unless `--apply` is present.
5. With `--apply`, write a dated profile note under `datasets/<slug>/profiles/` and update `MANIFEST.md` summary fields if unambiguous.

### Sample

Samples must stay tiny and representative:

1. Default `--limit` is 20 rows or equivalent.
2. If the dataset is remote or compressed/large, write a sampling recipe instead of fetching.
3. Never save secrets, private data, or more than a small excerpt.
4. Dry-run by default unless `--apply` is present.
5. With `--apply`, write under `datasets/<slug>/samples/` and update indexes.

### Report

Always include:

- Dataset registry path
- Manifests created/updated, if any
- Migration candidates found, if any
- Reminder when dry-run mode was used
