## Quickstart [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#quickstart)

Add durable libSQL persistence to an existing Flue project with the [libSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) blueprint. Run the following command in your terminal or coding agent of choice:

```
flue add database libsql
```

## Overview [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#overview)

The libSQL blueprint installs `@flue/libsql` and `@libsql/client`, creates a source-root `db.ts`, and updates existing environment documentation when the project has it. The generated adapter maps client result sets to plain objects and serializes operations so a local SQLite file does not receive overlapping writes from one process:

```
import { libsql } from '@flue/libsql';
import { createClient, type ResultSet } from '@libsql/client';

const client = createClient({ url: process.env.LIBSQL_URL! });

export default libsql({
  query: (text, params = []) => {
    // await client.execute({ sql: text, args: params }))),
    // ...
  }
  transaction: (fn) => {
    // const tx = await client.transaction('write');
    // ...
  }
  close: () => client.close(),
});
```

Flue discovers the adapter at build time and wires it into the generated Node server. On startup, it creates or verifies the required `flue_*` tables. Agent sessions, accepted submissions, and workflow-run records then persist in a local SQLite file or self-hosted libSQL server according to `LIBSQL_URL`; application business data remains application-owned. Embedded replicas require additional `syncUrl` client configuration. The blueprint applies only to Node targets because Cloudflare deployments use Durable Object SQLite instead.

## Configure [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#configure)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LIBSQL_URL` | **Required** — A local file (`file:./data/flue.db`) or a libSQL server (`http://host:8080`). |

`createClient` reads this at runtime — it is not baked into the build. For local
development, `flue dev --env <file>` and `flue run --env <file>` load any
`.env`-format file. In production, supply it from your platform’s secret store.

The blueprint installs `@flue/libsql` and the official `@libsql/client`, and
writes a source-root `db.ts` that wraps the client. Flue discovers `db.ts` at
build time and wires it into the generated Node server. For hosted Turso, use
[`flue add database turso`](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/turso/) instead — it is the same
adapter with a Turso client configuration.

`@flue/libsql` is a **Node.js** adapter. The Cloudflare target uses Durable
Object SQLite automatically and rejects a `db.ts` file at build time, so this
guide applies to Node deployments. See [Database](https://flueframework.com/docs/guide/database/) for the
full picture of how state is stored on each target.

## Bring your own driver [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#bring-your-own-driver)

`@flue/libsql` does not pick or bundle a database driver. It runs against a
small runner you wrap around your configured
[`@libsql/client`](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/ts/reference), so you own the
client and its connection options. A runner is three functions: `query` (a SQL
string with `?` placeholders plus positional params, resolving to result rows),
`transaction` (runs its callback inside one `write` transaction), and `close`.
`@libsql/client` returns a `ResultSet`, so map its `rows`/`columns` into plain
objects:

```
import { libsql } from '@flue/libsql';
import { createClient, type ResultSet } from '@libsql/client';

const client = createClient({ url: process.env.LIBSQL_URL! });

const toRows = (rs: ResultSet) =>
  rs.rows.map((row) => Object.fromEntries(rs.columns.map((column) => [column, row[column]])));

let tail: Promise<unknown> = Promise.resolve();
const serialize = <T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> => {
  const result = tail.then(operation, operation);
  tail = result.then(
    () => undefined,
    () => undefined,
  );
  return result;
};

export default libsql({
  query: (text, params = []) =>
    serialize(async () => toRows(await client.execute({ sql: text, args: params }))),
  transaction: (fn) =>
    serialize(async () => {
      const tx = await client.transaction('write');
      try {
        const result = await fn({
          query: async (text, params = []) => toRows(await tx.execute({ sql: text, args: params })),
        });
        await tx.commit();
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        await tx.rollback();
        throw error;
      } finally {
        tx.close();
      }
    }),
  close: () => client.close(),
});
```

## Connection targets [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#connection-targets)

`createClient` decides where state lives — the adapter is identical across all
of them:

| Target | `createClient(...)` |
| --- | --- |
| Local SQLite file | `{ url: 'file:./data/flue.db' }` |
| Self-hosted libSQL server (`sqld`) | `{ url: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080' }` |
| Embedded replica (local file synced to a remote) | `{ url: 'file:local.db', syncUrl, authToken }` |
| Hosted Turso | see the [Turso guide](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/turso/) |

### Embedded-file concurrency [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#embedded-file-concurrency)

When `LIBSQL_URL` is a local `file:` database, asynchronous writes can overlap
and surface `SQLITE_BUSY`. The runner above serializes all operations from one
process so its transactions do not contend with top-level queries. Flue does
not promise multi-process or multi-tenant writes to one embedded file. A
self-hosted libSQL server and hosted Turso serialize writes server-side.

## Migrations [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#migrations)

The adapter’s `migrate()` hook runs automatically when the generated Node
server starts. It creates Flue’s `flue_*` tables idempotently and stamps a
schema version, so a fresh database is provisioned on first boot and an existing
one is reused on restart. There is no separate migration command to run, and a
database written by a newer Flue refuses to start rather than corrupting state.

## What gets stored [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#what-gets-stored)

A Flue database stores runtime state, not your whole application.

| Stored by Flue | Not stored by Flue |
| --- | --- |
| Agent session messages and compaction state | Sandbox files and installed dependencies |
| Accepted direct prompts and `dispatch(...)` submissions | External API side effects |
| Workflow-run records and persisted events | Application-owned business data unless your own tools store it |
| Run indexing for `/runs` lookups and `listRuns()` | Provider credentials or secrets |

See [Durable Agents](https://flueframework.com/docs/concepts/durable-execution/) for how recovery uses
submission state, and the [Data Persistence API](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/data-persistence-api/)
for the exact adapter contract.

## When to choose libSQL [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/libsql/\#when-to-choose-libsql)

| Use case | Adapter |
| --- | --- |
| Local development | `sqlite()` from `@flue/runtime/node`, or libSQL against a `file:` database |
| Single-host Node deployment | File-backed `sqlite()` or libSQL `file:` |
| Self-hosted SQLite over the network, or an embedded replica | `@flue/libsql` |
| Hosted, replicated SQLite | `@flue/libsql` against [Turso](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/turso/) |
| Multi-replica Node deployment on Postgres | [`@flue/postgres`](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/postgres/) |

libSQL is the right choice when you want SQLite’s model but reachable over the
network or kept close to the app as an embedded replica. For a fully managed,
replicated deployment, point the same adapter at [Turso](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/turso/).
