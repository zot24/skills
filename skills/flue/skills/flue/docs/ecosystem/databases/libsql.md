## Quickstart

Add durable libSQL persistence to an existing Flue project with the [libSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) blueprint. Run the following command in your terminal or coding agent of choice:

``` astro-code
flue add database libsql
```

## Overview

The libSQL blueprint installs `@flue/libsql` and `@libsql/client`, creates a source-root `db.ts`, and updates existing environment documentation when the project has it. The generated adapter maps client result sets to plain objects and serializes operations so a local SQLite file does not receive overlapping writes from one process:

``` astro-code
import { libsql } from '@flue/libsql';
import { createClient, type ResultSet } from '@libsql/client';

const client = createClient({ url: process.env.LIBSQL_URL! });

export default libsql({
  query: (text, params = []) => {
    // await client.execute({ sql: text, args: params }))),
    // ...
  }
  transaction: (fn) => {
    // const tx = await client.transaction('write');
    // ...
  }
  close: () => client.close(),
});
```

Flue discovers the adapter at build time and wires it into the generated Node server. On startup, it creates or verifies the required `flue_*` tables. Canonical agent conversations, immutable attachments, accepted submissions, and workflow history then persist in a local SQLite file or self-hosted libSQL server according to `LIBSQL_URL`; application business data remains application-owned. Embedded replicas require additional `syncUrl` client configuration. The blueprint applies only to Node targets because Cloudflare deployments use Durable Object SQLite instead.

## Configure

| Variable | Purpose |
|----|----|
| `LIBSQL_URL` | **Required** — A local file (`file:./data/flue.db`) or a libSQL server (`http://host:8080`). |

`createClient` reads this at runtime — it is not baked into the build. For local development, `flue dev --env <file>` and `flue run --env <file>` load any `.env`-format file. In production, supply it from your platform’s secret store.

The blueprint installs `@flue/libsql` and the official `@libsql/client`, and writes a source-root `db.ts` that wraps the client. Flue discovers `db.ts` at build time and wires it into the generated Node server. For hosted Turso, use [`flue add database turso`](/docs/ecosystem/databases/turso/) instead — it is the same adapter with a Turso client configuration.

`@flue/libsql` is a **Node.js** adapter. The Cloudflare target uses Durable Object SQLite automatically and rejects a `db.ts` file at build time, so this guide applies to Node deployments. See [Database](/docs/guide/database/) for the full picture of how state is stored on each target.

## Bring your own driver

`@flue/libsql` does not pick or bundle a database driver. It runs against a small runner you wrap around your configured [`@libsql/client`](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/ts/reference), so you own the client and its connection options. A runner is three functions: `query` (a SQL string with `?` placeholders plus positional params, resolving to result rows), `transaction` (runs its callback inside one `write` transaction), and `close`. `@libsql/client` returns a `ResultSet`, so map its `rows`/`columns` into plain objects:

``` astro-code
import { libsql } from '@flue/libsql';
import { createClient, type ResultSet } from '@libsql/client';

const client = createClient({ url: process.env.LIBSQL_URL! });

const toRows = (rs: ResultSet) =>
  rs.rows.map((row) => Object.fromEntries(rs.columns.map((column) => [column, row[column]])));

let tail: Promise<unknown> = Promise.resolve();
const serialize = <T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> => {
  const result = tail.then(operation, operation);
  tail = result.then(
    () => undefined,
    () => undefined,
  );
  return result;
};

export default libsql({
  query: (text, params = []) =>
    serialize(async () => toRows(await client.execute({ sql: text, args: params }))),
  transaction: (fn) =>
    serialize(async () => {
      const tx = await client.transaction('write');
      try {
        const result = await fn({
          query: async (text, params = []) => toRows(await tx.execute({ sql: text, args: params })),
        });
        await tx.commit();
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        await tx.rollback();
        throw error;
      } finally {
        tx.close();
      }
    }),
  close: () => client.close(),
});
```

## Connection targets

`createClient` decides where state lives — the adapter is identical across all of them:

| Target | `createClient(...)` |
|----|----|
| Local SQLite file | `{ url: 'file:./data/flue.db' }` |
| Self-hosted libSQL server (`sqld`) | `{ url: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080' }` |
| Embedded replica (local file synced to a remote) | `{ url: 'file:local.db', syncUrl, authToken }` |
| Hosted Turso | see the [Turso guide](/docs/ecosystem/databases/turso/) |

### Embedded-file concurrency

When `LIBSQL_URL` is a local `file:` database, asynchronous writes can overlap and surface `SQLITE_BUSY`. The runner above serializes all operations from one process so its transactions do not contend with top-level queries. Flue does not promise multi-process or multi-tenant writes to one embedded file. A self-hosted libSQL server and hosted Turso serialize writes server-side.

## Migrations

The adapter’s `migrate()` hook runs automatically when the generated Node server starts. It creates Flue’s `flue_*` tables idempotently and stamps a schema version, so a fresh database is provisioned on first boot and an existing one is reused on restart. There is no separate migration command to run, and a database written by a newer Flue refuses to start rather than corrupting state.

## What gets stored

A Flue database stores runtime state, not your whole application.

| Stored by Flue | Not stored by Flue |
|----|----|
| Canonical agent conversation streams and compaction records | Sandbox files and installed dependencies |
| Immutable attachment payloads | External API side effects |
| Accepted direct prompts and `dispatch(...)` submissions | Application-owned business data unless your own tools store it |
| Workflow-run records and persisted events | Provider credentials or secrets |
| Run indexing for `/runs` lookups and `listRuns()` |  |

See [Durable Agents](/docs/concepts/durable-execution/) for how recovery uses submission state, and the [Data Persistence API](/docs/api/data-persistence-api/) for the exact adapter contract.

## When to choose libSQL

| Use case | Adapter |
|----|----|
| Local development | `sqlite()` from `@flue/runtime/node`, or libSQL against a `file:` database |
| Single-host Node deployment | File-backed `sqlite()` or libSQL `file:` |
| Self-hosted SQLite over the network, or an embedded replica | `@flue/libsql` |
| Hosted, replicated SQLite | `@flue/libsql` against [Turso](/docs/ecosystem/databases/turso/) |
| Multi-replica Node deployment on Postgres | [`@flue/postgres`](/docs/ecosystem/databases/postgres/) |

libSQL is the right choice when you want SQLite’s model but reachable over the network or kept close to the app as an embedded replica. For a fully managed, replicated deployment, point the same adapter at [Turso](/docs/ecosystem/databases/turso/).
