## Quickstart [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/redis/\#quickstart)

Add durable, shared state to an existing Flue project with the [Redis](https://redis.io/) blueprint. Run the following command in your terminal or coding agent of choice:

```
flue add database redis
```

## Overview [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/redis/\#overview)

The Redis blueprint installs `@flue/redis` and the official `redis` client,
creates a `db.ts` in the project’s source-root, and follows the project’s
existing secret convention for `REDIS_URL`. It does not modify deployment
configuration because persistence and recovery settings remain owned by the
Redis deployment.

The primary generated adapter connects the client and translates Flue database
operations into Redis commands:

```
import { redis } from '@flue/redis';
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL });
await client.connect();

export default redis({
  command: (command, args = []) => client.sendCommand([command, ...args.map(String)]),
  eval: (script, keys, args = []) => client.eval(script, { keys, arguments: args.map(String) }),
  close: () => client.close(),
});
```

This abridged excerpt omits the generated pipeline helper, which batches
commands and rejects any `Error` result. Flue discovers the adapter during a
Node build, checks and migrates its Redis namespace at server startup, and
persists agent sessions, accepted submissions, workflow runs, and event streams
so that they survive Flue process restarts. Durability across Redis server loss
depends on the deployment’s AOF or snapshot configuration.

## Configure [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/redis/\#configure)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `REDIS_URL` | **Required** — Connection URL for a persistent standalone or single-shard Redis deployment. |

The blueprint installs `@flue/redis` and the official `redis` (node-redis)
client, then writes a source-root `db.ts`. This is a **Node.js** adapter. The
Cloudflare target uses Durable Object SQLite and rejects `db.ts`.

Set `REDIS_URL` to a persistent standalone Redis server or managed single-shard
endpoint. Redis Cluster and cache-only configurations are unsupported. Configure
`maxmemory-policy noeviction`, plus AOF with an explicit fsync policy and/or
durable snapshots appropriate to your recovery objective. `noeviction` avoids
silent eviction; it does not make acknowledged writes durable across server
loss.

The canonical runner uses the official client:

```
import { redis } from '@flue/redis';
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL });
await client.connect();

export default redis({
  command: (command, args = []) => client.sendCommand([command, ...args.map(String)]),
  eval: (script, keys, args = []) =>
    client.eval(script, {
      keys,
      arguments: args.map(String),
    }),
  pipeline: async (commands) => {
    const multi = client.multi();
    for (const { command, args = [] } of commands) multi.addCommand([command, ...args.map(String)]);
    const results = await multi.exec();
    for (const result of results) if (result instanceof Error) throw result;
    return results;
  },
  close: () => client.close(),
});
```

## Inspection and isolation [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/redis/\#inspection-and-isolation)

At startup, `inspectServer` uses `CONFIG GET`, falling back to `INFO`, to verify
that Cluster is disabled and the eviction policy is `noeviction`. Startup fails
when either requirement cannot be verified. Set `inspectServer: false` only when
a managed single-shard provider denies both commands and you have independently
verified the configuration.

Use a dedicated Redis database or pass a stable, unique `keyPrefix` as the
adapter’s second argument. The default is `flue`. Changing it selects a separate
namespace; it does not move existing keys.

## Migrations and stored data [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/redis/\#migrations-and-stored-data)

Flue runs `migrate()` at startup. It initializes schema-version metadata
idempotently and refuses data from an unsupported newer schema; there is no
separate migration command.

Redis stores session messages and compaction state, accepted prompts and
dispatches, recovery journals, workflow runs and indexes, and persisted event
streams. It does not store sandbox files, external API side effects, secrets, or
application business data.

## Verify durability [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/databases/redis/\#verify-durability)

Build the Node target, start it against a throwaway correctly configured Redis,
create state, restart Flue, and confirm the state reloads. Separately test the
chosen AOF or snapshot recovery procedure: restarting Flue does not prove that
Redis survives server loss.
