Flue’s Node target is a long-running HTTP server, not a serverless function, so it deploys to Render as a web service that stays up between requests. This guide covers the Render-specific setup; the build itself is the same `node` target described in [Deploy Agents on Node.js](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/node/) — `npx flue build --target node` produces `dist/server.mjs`, which you start with `node dist/server.mjs`.

The fastest start is the [Flue template](https://render.com/templates/flue): a one-click Blueprint that provisions a Node web service running the translation and assistant agents. The [Flue + Postgres template](https://render.com/templates/flue-with-postgresql) is the same service with a Render Postgres database wired in. Both render the rest of this guide as the explanation of what they set up.

## Deploy [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/render/\#deploy)

Render reads a Blueprint — a `render.yaml` at the repo root — to provision the service as code. A Flue web service is a Node runtime with the build and start commands from the Node guide:

```
services:
  - type: web
    name: flue-agents
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci && npx flue build --target node
    startCommand: node dist/server.mjs
    healthCheckPath: /health
    envVars:
      - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        sync: false
```

- `buildCommand` compiles the Flue Node target. The build externalizes your dependencies rather than bundling them, so `node_modules` must be present at runtime — `npm ci` installs them, and `@flue/cli` must be available to the build command.
- `startCommand` runs the generated server, which binds the `PORT` Render injects and serves agents at `/agents/<name>/<id>` and workflows at `/workflows/<name>`.
- `healthCheckPath` lets Render verify each deploy before shifting traffic to it — but only if your application defines that route (see [Health and streaming](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/render/#health-and-streaming)).

Push the file and create a Blueprint from the Render Dashboard ( **New > Blueprint**), or click **Deploy to Render** from a template. Render copies the template repo to your GitHub account, prompts for any `sync: false` secrets, and deploys. To auto-deploy on every push, set `autoDeployTrigger: commit` on the service (this replaces the deprecated `autoDeploy` field).

The template uses `plan: free`, so first deploys cost nothing. Free web services spin down after 15 minutes without inbound traffic, and the next request pays a cold start — about a minute — while the Node process restarts. In-memory session state is also lost across that restart. For agents that see sporadic production traffic, move to `starter` or higher to keep the service warm, and add Postgres for durable sessions.

## Environment and secrets [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/render/\#environment-and-secrets)

The built server reads only the environment present when it starts — it does not load `.env` — so configuration lives in Render environment variables, set in the Dashboard or declared in `render.yaml`. Flue needs the API key for your model provider, plus an optional model specifier:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Authenticates calls to your model provider. Use the name your provider expects. |
| `MODEL_SPECIFIER` | Optional default model, e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`, if your app reads one from the environment. |

Declare secret values with `sync: false` so they stay out of the Blueprint — Render prompts for them on first deploy and stores them on the service. Non-secret values like a model specifier can carry a literal `value`:

```
envVars:
  - key: MODEL_SPECIFIER
    value: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
  - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    sync: false
```

Render ignores `sync: false` variables when updating an existing Blueprint, so rotate those secrets from the Dashboard. Do not set the reserved `FLUE_MODE` or `FLUE_CLI_*` variables in production.

## Persistence [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/render/\#persistence)

The Node target keeps agent sessions and accepted submissions in memory by default. That state is lost on every restart, deploy, and free-plan spin-down, and it is not shared across instances — an in-memory service that scales past one instance routes follow-up requests to processes that never saw the original session.

For durable, shared session history, add a Render Postgres database to the Blueprint and wire its connection string into the web service with `fromDatabase`:

```
databases:
  - name: flue-db
    plan: basic-256mb

services:
  - type: web
    name: flue-agents
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci && npx flue build --target node
    startCommand: node dist/server.mjs
    healthCheckPath: /health
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: flue-db
          property: connectionString
      - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        sync: false
```

`fromDatabase` supplies the database’s internal connection string — the one Render recommends for services in the same account and region, since it stays on the private network. Install the adapter and read `DATABASE_URL` in `db.ts`:

```
npm install @flue/postgres
```

```
import { postgres } from '@flue/postgres';

export default postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
```

Flue discovers `db.ts` at build time and wires it into the generated server — schema creation, session snapshots, and durable submission state are handled by the adapter. See [Database](https://flueframework.com/docs/guide/database/) for the adapter contract and alternatives. Note that a `free` Postgres database expires 30 days after creation; use a `basic-256mb` or larger plan for anything you intend to keep.

## Health and streaming [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/render/\#health-and-streaming)

Flue does not generate a `/health` route. If you set `healthCheckPath`, define the matching route in `app.ts` — otherwise the check never passes and Render holds the deploy back. Drop `healthCheckPath` if you don’t want a health gate.

Streamed runs are served over a long-lived `GET /runs/:runId` connection (long-poll/SSE). Render imposes no fixed idle timeout on a web service connection and allows a request to run up to 100 minutes, so a single streaming connection is well within bounds. The real risk to a long-lived stream is instance replacement: Render may replace an instance during a deploy or routine maintenance, and terminating the old instance closes every connection to it. For agents that run long tool chains, prefer reading the run’s stream coordinates and reconnecting to `/runs/:runId` over holding one blocking `?wait=result` request, so a client can resume after a reconnect. The server’s `SIGTERM` shutdown delay (default 30s, raise via `maxShutdownDelaySeconds` up to 300s) governs how long in-flight work has to finish during a graceful shutdown.

## Going further [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/deploy/render/\#going-further)

- **Scheduled workflows.** Model periodic tasks (nightly summaries, cache refreshes) as a Render cron job rather than inbound agent traffic. Add a `type: cron` service with a `schedule` (standard cron syntax, evaluated in UTC) whose `startCommand` is `npx flue run <workflow> --target node`. Each fire builds, runs the workflow once, and exits — close any Postgres connections so the process terminates cleanly. Render runs at most one instance of a given cron job at a time and stops a run after 12 hours.
- **Background workers.** For continuous, queue-driven delivery, add a `type: worker` service. A worker has no public port; it runs `node dist/server.mjs` (or a custom entry), makes attached agent requests and waits for results, or has application code call `dispatch(...)` for asynchronous delivery identified by `dispatchId`.
