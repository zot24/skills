# Deploy Agents on Render

Flue’s Node target is a long-running HTTP server, not a serverless function, so it deploys to Render as a web service that stays up between requests. This guide covers the Render-specific setup; the build itself is the same `node` target described in [Deploy Agents on Node.js](/docs/ecosystem/deploy/node/) — `npx vite build` (with the `flue()` plugin in `vite.config.ts`) produces `dist/server.mjs`, which you start with `node dist/server.mjs`.

The fastest start is the [Flue template](https://render.com/templates/flue): a one-click Blueprint that provisions a Node web service running the translation and assistant agents. The [Flue + Postgres template](https://render.com/templates/flue-with-postgresql) is the same service with a Render Postgres database wired in. Both render the rest of this guide as the explanation of what they set up.

## Deploy

Render reads a Blueprint — a `render.yaml` at the repo root — to provision the service as code. A Flue web service is a Node runtime with the build and start commands from the Node guide:

<figure class="astro-code-figure">
<pre class="astro-code github-light" style="background-color:#fff;color:#24292e; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="yaml"><code>services:
  - type: web
    name: flue-agents
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci &amp;&amp; npx vite build
    startCommand: node dist/server.mjs
    healthCheckPath: /health
    envVars:
      - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        sync: false</code></pre>
<figcaption><span>render.yaml</span></figcaption>
</figure>

- `buildCommand` compiles the Flue Node target. The build externalizes your dependencies rather than bundling them, so `node_modules` must be present at runtime — `npm ci` installs them, and `vite` plus `@flue/vite` must be available to the build command.
- `startCommand` runs the generated server, which binds the `PORT` Render injects and serves agent conversations at whatever paths `app.ts` mounts them.
- `healthCheckPath` lets Render verify each deploy before shifting traffic to it — but only if your application defines that route (see [Health and streaming](#health-and-streaming)).

Push the file and create a Blueprint from the Render Dashboard (**New \> Blueprint**), or click **Deploy to Render** from a template. Render copies the template repo to your GitHub account, prompts for any `sync: false` secrets, and deploys. To auto-deploy on every push, set `autoDeployTrigger: commit` on the service (this replaces the deprecated `autoDeploy` field).

The template uses `plan: free`, so first deploys cost nothing. Free web services spin down after 15 minutes without inbound traffic, and the next request pays a cold start — about a minute — while the Node process restarts. In-memory conversation and submission state is also lost across that restart. For agents that see sporadic production traffic, move to `starter` or higher to keep the service warm, and add Postgres for durable recovery.

## Environment and secrets

The built server reads only the environment present when it starts — it does not load `.env` — so configuration lives in Render environment variables, set in the Dashboard or declared in `render.yaml`. Flue needs the API key for your model provider, plus an optional model specifier:

| Variable                               | Purpose                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Authenticates calls to your model provider. Use the name your provider expects.                         |
| `MODEL_SPECIFIER`                      | Optional default model, e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`, if your app reads one from the environment. |

Declare secret values with `sync: false` so they stay out of the Blueprint — Render prompts for them on first deploy and stores them on the service. Non-secret values like a model specifier can carry a literal `value`:

``` astro-code
envVars:
  - key: MODEL_SPECIFIER
    value: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
  - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    sync: false
```

Render ignores `sync: false` variables when updating an existing Blueprint, so rotate those secrets from the Dashboard.

## Persistence

The Node target keeps canonical agent conversations and accepted submissions in memory by default. That state is lost on every restart, deploy, and free-plan spin-down.

For durable process or host replacement, add a Render Postgres database to the Blueprint and wire its connection string into the web service with `fromDatabase`. A shared database does not enable active-active ownership of one agent instance: route each instance to one live Node process and avoid overlapping owners during replacement.

<figure class="astro-code-figure">
<pre class="astro-code github-light" style="background-color:#fff;color:#24292e; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="yaml"><code>databases:
  - name: flue-db
    plan: basic-256mb

services:
  - type: web
    name: flue-agents
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci &amp;&amp; npx vite build
    startCommand: node dist/server.mjs
    healthCheckPath: /health
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: flue-db
          property: connectionString
      - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        sync: false</code></pre>
<figcaption><span>render.yaml</span></figcaption>
</figure>

`fromDatabase` supplies the database’s internal connection string — the one Render recommends for services in the same account and region, since it stays on the private network. Install the adapter and read `DATABASE_URL` in `db.ts`:

``` astro-code
npm install @flue/postgres
```

<figure class="astro-code-figure">
<pre class="astro-code github-light" style="background-color:#fff;color:#24292e; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="typescript"><code>import { postgres } from &#39;@flue/postgres&#39;;
import { Pool } from &#39;pg&#39;;

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });

export default postgres({
  query: async (text, params) =&gt; (await pool.query(text, params)).rows,
  transaction: async (fn) =&gt; {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      await client.query(&#39;BEGIN&#39;);
      const result = await fn({
        query: async (text, params) =&gt; (await client.query(text, params)).rows,
      });
      await client.query(&#39;COMMIT&#39;);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      await client.query(&#39;ROLLBACK&#39;);
      throw error;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  },
  close: () =&gt; pool.end(),
});</code></pre>
<figcaption><span>src/db.ts</span></figcaption>
</figure>

Flue discovers `db.ts` at build time and wires it into the generated server — schema creation, canonical conversation streams, immutable attachments, and durable submission state are handled by the adapter. See [Database](/docs/guide/database/) for the adapter contract and alternatives, and [Postgres](/docs/ecosystem/databases/postgres/) for the bring-your-own-driver details. Note that a `free` Postgres database expires 30 days after creation; use a `basic-256mb` or larger plan for anything you intend to keep.

## Health and streaming

Flue does not generate a `/health` route. If you set `healthCheckPath`, define the matching route in `app.ts` — otherwise the check never passes and Render holds the deploy back. Drop `healthCheckPath` if you don’t want a health gate.

Agent conversations are served through long-lived `GET` reads on the conversation URL (long-poll/SSE). Render imposes no fixed idle timeout and allows a request to run up to 100 minutes. Instance replacement can still close connections, so retain the admission’s `streamUrl` and `offset` and resume the conversation stream rather than holding one blocking request open. The server’s `SIGTERM` shutdown delay (default 30s, up to 300s via `maxShutdownDelaySeconds`) governs graceful shutdown. See the [Streaming Protocol](/docs/reference/streaming-protocol/).

## Going further

- **Scheduled agents.** Model periodic tasks as a Render cron job that calls the deployed application’s authenticated agent endpoint — a `POST` to the agent’s conversation URL with a `kind: 'signal'` message. Calling the deployed application avoids rebuilding and starting a second runtime for every fire. Render runs at most one instance of a given cron job at a time and stops a run after 12 hours. See [Schedules](/docs/guide/schedules/).
- **Background workers.** For continuous, queue-driven delivery, add a `type: worker` service. A worker has no public port; it runs `node dist/server.mjs` (or a custom entry), makes attached agent requests and waits for results, or has application code call `dispatch(...)` for asynchronous delivery identified by the receipt’s `submissionId`.
