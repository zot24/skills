Flue exposes stable machine-readable error categories through its public transports. Runtime operations, workflow records, CLI commands, development servers, and builds also report failures, but not every surface uses the transport error vocabulary.

## Public transport errors

#### `FluePublicError`

``` astro-code
interface FluePublicError {
  type: string;
  message: string;
  details: string;
  dev?: string;
  meta?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

Caller-safe error details exposed by Flue transports. Unknown failures become a generic `internal_error` payload without leaking their original message. Branch on `type`, not message prose.

| Field | Meaning |
|----|----|
| `type` | Stable machine-readable error category. |
| `message` | Short caller-facing summary. |
| `details` | Caller-facing explanation. |
| `dev` | Additional local development guidance when available. |
| `meta` | Structured error-specific metadata when available. For example, validation issue details. |

`dev` is omitted unless the runtime has additional guidance and is running locally. Temporary local `flue run` runtimes use local error rendering on Node.js and in Cloudflare’s Vite/workerd development runtime. An absolute `--server` attachment renders whatever envelope that server provides; preview and production builds omit local-only guidance.

### Categories

The following categories are stable for framework-owned transport failures. HTTP responses use the listed status code.

| Type | HTTP status | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| `method_not_allowed` | `405` | The endpoint does not accept the request method. HTTP responses include `Allow`. |
| `unsupported_media_type` | `415` | A request body was not sent as JSON. |
| `invalid_json` | `400` | A request body could not be read or parsed as JSON. |
| `agent_not_found` | `404` | The requested agent is not registered or not exposed through the requested transport. |
| `workflow_not_found` | `404` | The requested workflow is not registered or not exposed over HTTP. |
| `route_not_found` | `404` | No generated default-application route matches the request. |
| `run_not_found` | `404` | The workflow run is missing, expired, or not owned by the resolved workflow instance. |
| `stream_not_found` | `404` | The agent-instance event stream does not exist yet; agent streams are created on first admitted prompt. |
| `run_store_unavailable` | `501` | The runtime does not provide workflow-run storage, lookup, or listing. |
| `invalid_request` | `400` | The request shape, parameters, or protocol message is invalid. Read `details` for the specific reason. |
| `internal_error` | `500` | An unknown or non-public server failure occurred. |

## Transport envelopes

| Surface | Envelope |
|----|----|
| Framework HTTP error response | `{ error: FluePublicError }` |
| Durable Streams invalid-query or missing-stream response | `{ error: FluePublicError }` |

Durable Streams reads use the same framework envelope for invalid query parameters and missing streams. A stream may still terminate through transport behavior rather than a JSON error body, such as a client disconnect during SSE.

See [Events Reference](/docs/api/events-reference/) for runtime event types.

### Workflow-run streams

Workflow failures normally appear in a terminal `run_end` event with `isError: true`.

## Workflow-run and operation failures

Workflow-run records, `run_end` events, and operation events expose open-ended `error?: unknown` values. Runtime exceptions are commonly serialized as `{ name, message }` when recorded. These failure records are structured observation data, not a closed list of machine-readable transport categories.

## Runtime exceptions

### `FlueError`

``` astro-code
class FlueError extends Error {
  readonly type: string;
  readonly details: string;
  readonly dev: string;
  readonly meta?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

The catchable base class for framework-thrown runtime failures, exported from `@flue/runtime`. Application code distinguishes Flue failures from arbitrary errors with `instanceof FlueError`, then narrows with the concrete subclasses below or the stable `type` field. Message, `details`, and `dev` strings are human-readable prose, not API.

### Runtime errors

Harness and session operations, and runtime provider registration, reject with typed `FlueError` subclasses, all importable from `@flue/runtime`:

| Class | `type` | Thrown when |
|----|----|----|
| `SessionNotFoundError` | `session_not_found` | `sessions.get()` targets a session that does not exist. |
| `SessionAlreadyExistsError` | `session_already_exists` | `sessions.create()` targets a session that already exists. |
| `SessionBusyError` | `session_busy` | An operation starts while another operation is running. |
| `SkillNotRegisteredError` | `skill_not_registered` | A skill call or activation names a skill that is not registered. |
| `DelegationDepthExceededError` | `delegation_depth_exceeded` | Nested Task and Action delegation exceeds the supported depth. |
| `SubagentNotDeclaredError` | `subagent_not_declared` | `task()` names a subagent the agent does not declare. |
| `ToolNameConflictError` | `tool_name_conflict` | Custom or sandbox adapter tool names collide with each other or with framework-reserved names. |
| `ToolLegacyDefinitionError` | `tool_legacy_definition` | A tool definition uses the removed `parameters` or `execute` fields. `meta.fields` lists the legacy fields found. |
| `ToolInputValidationError` | `tool_input_validation` | Model-supplied tool arguments fail the tool’s Valibot `input` schema. The agent loop converts the throw into an error tool result so the model can retry; `meta.tool` and `meta.issues` identify the tool and failures. |
| `ToolOutputValidationError` | `tool_output_validation` | A tool’s return value fails its Valibot `output` schema. `meta.tool` and `meta.issues` identify the tool and failures. |
| `ToolOutputSerializationError` | `tool_output_serialization` | A tool’s parsed return value cannot be snapshotted as JSON-compatible data, or an output schema produces `undefined`. `meta.tool` identifies the tool. |
| `OperationFailedError` | `operation_failed` | An operation ran but did not complete successfully (for example, the model call errored). |
| `SubmissionTimeoutError` | `submission_timeout` | A durable submission exceeded its configured processing timeout. |
| `ProviderRegistrationError` | `invalid_provider_registration` | `registerProvider()` targets a non-catalog provider id without `api` and `baseUrl`. |

When one of these errors escapes to an HTTP transport (for example, a synchronous `?wait=result` invocation), the response body carries the error’s typed envelope with status `500` instead of the generic `internal_error` payload.

### `ResultUnavailableError`

``` astro-code
class ResultUnavailableError extends Error {
  readonly reason: string;
  readonly assistantText: string;
}
```

Thrown when an agent cannot produce a required structured result, either because it gives up or does not finish after follow-up attempts. Import it from `@flue/runtime` when application logic needs to handle that outcome separately.

### Cancellation

Aborted prompt, skill, task, and shell operations reject with a standard `AbortError` (`DOMException`) carrying the abort reason as `cause` when the runtime permits it. Cancellation is deliberately not part of the `FlueError` vocabulary.

Authoring and definition-time validation failures, such as invalid agent profiles, tool definitions, dispatch payloads, or model ids, reject with human-readable `Error` messages. Those messages are not stable machine-readable categories.

## CLI, build, and development diagnostics

CLI diagnostics are human-oriented messages written to stderr. They do not currently expose stable machine-readable error codes.

| Surface | Diagnostic families |
|----|----|
| CLI arguments | Unsupported flags, missing values, invalid targets, and invalid JSON payloads. |
| Configuration | Missing or invalid `flue.config.*` files, invalid default exports, unsupported fields, missing `target`, and environment files. |
| Build | Missing source modules, invalid or duplicate source names, generated module exports, imported skills, and target requirements. |
| Cloudflare build | Wrangler availability, compatibility settings, reserved bindings, target packages, and filename constraints. |
| `flue dev` initial build | Reports the build failure and exits. |
| `flue dev` rebuild | Reports the rebuild failure and keeps watching for a later fix. |

Use the actionable diagnostic prose when resolving these errors. Do not parse it as a stable API. See [`flue build`](/docs/cli/build/) and [`flue dev`](/docs/cli/dev/) for command behavior.

## Application-owned responses

An authored [`app.ts`](/docs/api/routing-api/) owns its request pipeline. Custom routes and middleware may return arbitrary statuses and bodies, including authorization responses. Flue does not impose an `unauthorized` transport category on application-owned responses.

## Stability boundary

| Surface | Contract |
|----|----|
| `FluePublicError` fields and documented categories | Stable public transport contract. |
| Exported `FlueError` subclasses and their `type` fields | Stable public runtime contract. |
| Workflow-run records, workflow events, and operation events | Structured but open-ended failure data. |
| Runtime exception messages and CLI, configuration, build messages | Human-oriented diagnostics subject to refinement. |
| Generated target internals | Implementation details, not public transport categories. |
