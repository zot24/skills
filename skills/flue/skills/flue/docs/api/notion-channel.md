## `createNotionChannel()` [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#createnotionchannel)

```
function createNotionChannel<E extends Env = Env>(
  options: NotionChannelOptions<E>,
): NotionChannel<E>;
```

Creates one stateless Notion webhook channel. At least one of
`verificationToken` or `verification` is required. `webhook` is always
required.

## `NotionChannelOptions` [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#notionchanneloptions)

```
interface NotionChannelOptions<E extends Env = Env> {
  verificationToken?: string;
  bodyLimit?: number;
  verification?(input: NotionVerificationHandlerInput<E>): NotionHandlerResult;
  webhook(input: NotionWebhookHandlerInput<E>): NotionHandlerResult;
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `verificationToken` | Token supplied by Notion during endpoint setup and used as the HMAC key. |
| `bodyLimit` | Maximum request-body size. Defaults to 1 MiB. |
| `verification` | Handles the initial unsigned verification-token request. |
| `webhook` | Receives every verified event after signature verification. |

The per-subscription signing token already establishes the sending identity
through signature verification, so the channel exposes no separate workspace,
subscription, or integration constraint options.

The constructor throws `TypeError` for missing handlers, an empty configured
token, a non-function callback, or a non-positive body limit.

## Initial verification [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#initial-verification)

```
interface NotionVerificationHandlerInput<E extends Env = Env> {
  c: Context<E>;
  verificationToken: string;
}
```

The initial setup request has no `X-Notion-Signature`. The channel accepts it
only when the JSON body is an object containing exactly one non-empty
`verification_token` field.

When `verificationToken` is configured, the channel returns an empty `200`
only when the received token matches; a mismatch returns `403`, and the
temporary `verification` callback is not invoked. Before a token is configured,
the `verification` callback receives the setup value and its result becomes the
response.

The verification callback is unauthenticated setup code. Store the token
outside the channel, then configure it as `verificationToken` for recurring
events. Signed events receive `503` while no verification token is configured.

## Recurring events [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#recurring-events)

```
interface NotionWebhookHandlerInput<E extends Env = Env> {
  c: Context<E>;
  event: NotionWebhookEvent;
}
```

Recurring requests require `application/json` and
`X-Notion-Signature: sha256=<64 hexadecimal characters>`. The signature is
HMAC-SHA256 over the exact request bytes using `verificationToken`.
Authentication runs before JSON parsing or `webhook`.

A verified event is forwarded to `webhook` whenever its parsed body is a JSON
object carrying a non-empty string `type`; the channel does not re-validate the
nested provider shape. Only a signed body that is unparseable JSON, not a JSON
object, or missing a string `type` receives `400`. Missing, malformed, or
changed signatures receive `401`. Signed events while no verification token is
configured receive `503`. Oversized bodies receive `413`; unsupported media
types receive `415`.

## Handler result [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#handler-result)

```
type JsonValue = null | boolean | number | string | JsonValue[] | { [key: string]: JsonValue };

type NotionHandlerResult =
  | undefined
  | JsonValue
  | Response
  | Promise<undefined | JsonValue | Response>;
```

Returning nothing produces an empty `200`. A JSON-compatible value becomes a
JSON response. A normal Hono or Fetch `Response` passes through unchanged.
Thrown callbacks and unsupported return values produce an empty `500`.

The package does not impose a handler deadline.

## `NotionChannel` [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#notionchannel)

```
interface NotionChannel<E extends Env = Env> {
  readonly routes: readonly ChannelRoute<E>[];
}

interface ChannelRoute<E extends Env = Env> {
  readonly method: string;
  readonly path: string;
  readonly handler: Handler<E>;
}
```

`routes` contains one `POST /webhook` declaration. A file named
`channels/notion.ts` is served at `POST /channels/notion/webhook` relative to
the `flue()` mount.

Notion has several unrelated resource families, so the package does not expose
conversation-key helpers. Applications define the page, database, data source,
comment, view, or file identity appropriate to their agent.

## `NotionWebhookEvent` [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#notionwebhookevent)

```
type NotionWebhookEvent = NotionKnownWebhookEvent;
```

`NotionWebhookEvent` is the provider-native webhook payload union, sourced from
the webhook payload types exported by the installed official Notion SDK. The
only adjustment is widening `authors` to include Notion’s documented `agent`
author type; `accessible_by` remains limited to the SDK’s `person | bot`
principal types. Field names, nesting, and discriminants are otherwise the
provider’s own. `switch (event.type)` narrows each modeled variant. The covered
event types are:

- Comments: `comment.created`, `comment.deleted`, `comment.updated`
- Data sources: `data_source.content_updated`, `data_source.created`,
`data_source.deleted`, `data_source.moved`, `data_source.schema_updated`,
`data_source.undeleted`
- Databases: `database.content_updated`, `database.created`,
`database.deleted`, `database.moved`, `database.schema_updated`,
`database.undeleted`
- File uploads: `file_upload.completed`, `file_upload.created`,
`file_upload.expired`, `file_upload.upload_failed`
- Pages: `page.content_updated`, `page.created`, `page.deleted`,
`page.locked`, `page.moved`, `page.properties_updated`,
`page.transcription_block.transcript_deleted`, `page.undeleted`,
`page.unlocked`
- Views: `view.created`, `view.deleted`, `view.updated`

Known events include `id`, `timestamp`, `workspace_id`, `workspace_name`,
`subscription_id`, `integration_id`, `authors`, `attempt_number`,
`api_version`, `entity`, and event-specific `data` when the provider supplies
it.

```
type NotionWebhookAuthorType = 'person' | 'bot' | 'agent';
type NotionWebhookAccessibleByType = 'person' | 'bot';
```

`@flue/notion` widens the official SDK’s current `authors` declaration to
include Notion’s documented `agent` author type. It does not add `agent` to the
optional `accessible_by` array, which remains `person | bot`. The channel does
not otherwise reshape the provider payload.

## Unmodeled and future events [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#unmodeled-and-future-events)

`NotionWebhookEvent` is a closed union over the event types the installed
`@notionhq/client` models. Notion can add event families and API versions, so
an authenticated event whose `type` is outside that union is still forwarded to
`webhook` with its native, provider-shaped snake-case fields — there is no
synthetic `type: 'unknown'` variant, no `eventType`, no `raw`, and no camel-case
mirror. At runtime such an event is typed as the union and reached through a
`default` arm; inspect `event.type` to handle a family newer than your installed
SDK.

```
async webhook({ event }) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'page.created':
      // narrowed to the modeled PageCreatedWebhookPayload shape
      return;
    default:
      // any other authenticated event, including types the installed SDK
      // does not yet model, with the provider's native field names
      return;
  }
}
```

Upgrading `@notionhq/client` widens the modeled union, so previously
unmodeled types begin narrowing under their own `case`.

## Delivery semantics [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/api/notion-channel/\#delivery-semantics)

The channel exposes Notion’s delivery `id` and `attempt_number` but does not
persist deduplication state or restore ordering. Resource and delivery ids are
identifiers, not authorization capabilities.

Webhook subscription creation, OAuth, installation and token storage,
resource-fetching policy, and outbound API tools remain application concerns.

See [Notion setup](https://flueframework.com/docs/ecosystem/channels/notion/) for initial verification,
official client composition, application-owned page identity, and Cloudflare
runtime notes.
