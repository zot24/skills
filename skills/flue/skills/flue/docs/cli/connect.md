## Synopsis [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/cli/connect/\#synopsis)

```
flue connect <agent> <instance-id> [--target node] [--root <path>] [--output <path>] [--config <path>] [--env <path>]
```

## Description [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/cli/connect/\#description)

`flue connect` builds the selected Node project and opens a local connection to one discovered agent instance. Enter one prompt per line. The connection remains open until end-of-input or interruption so the agent instance can be reused between prompts.

The local connection uses private child-process communication. The agent does not need public HTTP exposure, and application ingress middleware is not executed.

## Arguments [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/cli/connect/\#arguments)

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<agent>` | Agent module name to connect to. |
| `<instance-id>` | Agent-instance identifier. |

## Options [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/cli/connect/\#options)

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--target node` | Configuration value | Select the supported local connection target. |
| `--root <path>` | Selected config-file directory, or config search directory | Select the project root. |
| `--output <path>` | `<root>/dist` | Select the build output directory. |
| `--config <path>` | Auto-discovered `flue.config.*` | Select a configuration file. |
| `--env <path>` | `<config-base>/.env`, when present | Select one alternate `.env`-format file loaded before configuration. Relative paths resolve from `<config-base>`. Shell values win. |

## Output and exit behavior [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/cli/connect/\#output-and-exit-behavior)

Build diagnostics are written to stdout before the connection opens. Streamed agent events and prompt errors are written to stderr. A successful non-null prompt result is written as formatted JSON to stdout. Prompt errors do not close the interactive connection. End-of-input closes the connection.

## Target support [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/cli/connect/\#target-support)

`flue connect` supports local Node builds only. Use the [SDK](https://flueframework.com/docs/sdk/overview/) to interact with a deployed application.

## Examples [\#](https://flueframework.com/docs/cli/connect/\#examples)

```
flue connect assistant customer-123 --target node
flue connect assistant customer-123 --env .env.staging
```

See the [CLI overview](https://flueframework.com/docs/cli/overview/) for the complete development workflow.
