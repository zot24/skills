## Changelog

**v0.22.0** — **Declarative private-adapter routing.** Registered adapters
may declare provider-neutral intent and exact-URL routes plus an adapter-owned
workflow guide. The public plugin discovers the route before ingestion but no
longer embeds any provider's authentication, browser, recovery, or editing
workflow.

**v0.21.3** — **Adapter-boundary transition.** Consolidates the v0.21 line and
keeps the session-hook compatibility fix. Provider-specific workflow material
from that line is superseded in current source by manifest-driven routing and
lives only in the corresponding private adapter.

**v0.20.0** — **Governed remote writes.** Extends private adapters with exact
remote-resource allowlists, declared read/write effects, explicit approval
bound to an exact plan hash, expected revisions, stable idempotency keys,
private verified receipts, and content-free terminal reporting.

**v0.19.0** — **Private adapter protocol.** Adds an explicitly trusted,
machine-local adapter registry and portable `llm-wiki-adapter/v1` JSON contract,
with manifest handshakes, path scopes, sanitized environments, hash-verified
artifacts, bundled management CLI, and an explicit workflow boundary that never
passes a wiki destination or auto-promotes adapter output.

**v0.18.0** — **Hub-wide portfolio.** Adds `/wiki:portfolio`, a live read-only view across active topic wikis that lists canonical Ideas and active Projects separately, distinguishes explicitly promoted Projects from direct ones, preserves Concepts as supporting knowledge, and avoids catch-all topics, duplicated records, inferred lineage, and stale portfolio caches.

**v0.17.1** — **Accidental sensitive-data cleanup.** Adds a dry-run-first local command for removing accidentally saved passwords, tokens, and other sensitive values from registered wikis, archives, and session context. It accepts hidden or stdin input, detects common encoded forms, keeps the selected value out of command arguments and reports, and verifies the selected local scope after explicit application.

**v0.17.0** — **Ideas workflow.** Adds a fuzzy Concept → Idea → Project path: capture and catalog rough proposals under `inventory/ideas/`, research and shape them over time, then explicitly approve and promote a frozen `BRIEF.md` into a linked Project whose workspace owns delivery truth.

**v0.16.0** — **Query Lite and token benchmarks.** Adds a compact read-only query protocol across Claude Code, Codex, Pi, DS4, OpenCode, and portable agents; reduces Claude `/wiki:query` instructions by 72.54%; adds explicit `$wiki-query`, read-only Pi launchers, static context budgets, corpus-identity gates, and reproducible Codex/Claude/DS4 benchmark lanes. OpenCode live-model behavior remains best effort.

**v0.14.0** — **Default topic guides.** Adds advisory `schema.md` by default, safe adoption helpers for older wikis, proposal-only librarian convention updates, deterministic docs/lint checks, and clarifies the optional index/server layer as a rebuildable non-authoritative cache.

## Install

**Claude Code** (native plugin):
```bash
claude plugin install wiki@llm-wiki
```

**OpenAI Codex** (marketplace plugin):

Install from GitHub:
```bash
codex plugin marketplace add nvk/llm-wiki
codex plugin add wiki@llm-wiki
# Start a new Codex thread, then use @wiki or type $ to select wiki-query
```

Install from a local checkout with the managed bootstrap helper:
```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-codex-plugin.sh --scope user --verify
```

Or register the local checkout manually:
```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/llm-wiki
codex plugin add wiki@llm-wiki
```

Canonical explicit invocation:
```text
$wiki-query "What does the wiki say about hardware wallet threat models?"
@wiki research "hardware wallet threat models"
@wiki collect "bitcoin memes" --wiki memes-bitcoin
@wiki ingest https://example.com/article
@wiki audit --project coldcard-threat-model
@wiki session status
@wiki feedback list --unpromoted
@wiki session disable   # optional opt-out
@wiki ll "codex plugin install gotchas"
```

Upgrade:
```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade llm-wiki
codex plugin add wiki@llm-wiki
```

Remove:
```bash
codex plugin remove wiki@llm-wiki
codex plugin marketplace remove llm-wiki
```

Troubleshooting:
- `codex plugin marketplace add` registers the catalog; `codex plugin add wiki@llm-wiki` installs and enables the cached plugin non-interactively.
- Open `/hooks` to review and trust the bundled hooks if you want automated session capture. The `@wiki` skill works without hook trust.
- `$wiki-query` is the small, explicit, read-only skill for lookups. In Codex CLI/IDE, type `$` or open `/skills` and select it. It never activates implicitly or changes wiki files.
- `@wiki` is the full research and maintenance entry point. Natural-language wiki requests can still auto-activate it.
- Restart Codex after changing config if an existing session does not pick up the new plugin state.
- If you run Codex under a sandbox wrapper like `nono`, see [Nono Sandbox Permissions](#nono-sandbox-permissions) — Codex needs r+w to `$HOME/.codex` for plugin install.

**OpenCode** (instruction file):

Add to your `opencode.json` (project-level or `~/.config/opencode/.opencode.json` for global):
```json
{
  "instructions": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvk/llm-wiki/master/plugins/llm-wiki-opencode/skills/wiki-manager/SKILL.md"],
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": {
      "~/.config/llm-wiki/**": "allow",
      "~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/wiki/**": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

OpenCode fetches the URL fresh on every session start — no manual updates needed. If you prefer a local copy instead:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvk/llm-wiki/master/plugins/llm-wiki-opencode/skills/wiki-manager/SKILL.md > ~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md
```

For a smaller read-only setup, use the best-effort query preset instead:

```json
{
  "instructions": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvk/llm-wiki/master/plugins/llm-wiki-opencode/skills/wiki-query/SKILL.md"]
}
```

The OpenCode profile is sync- and budget-tested, but not tied to one model, so
it does not have a provider-specific live quality gate. Treat it as a portable
best-effort preset and keep OpenCode's write and shell permissions disabled for
query-only sessions.

The `external_directory` permission is required because the wiki hub lives outside the project directory. Set the paths to match your hub location. Alternatively, use `--local` mode (`.wiki/` in the project) to skip permissions entirely.

Web search requires `export OPENCODE_ENABLE_EXA=1`.

**Pi** (skill file, best for local models):

Pi's minimal system prompt leaves room for on-demand wiki workflows on local
models. Load the full skill for research and write-capable maintenance:

```bash
pi --skill path/to/llm-wiki/plugins/llm-wiki-opencode/skills/wiki-manager/SKILL.md
```

Invoke it as `/skill:wiki-manager`, or let Pi load it when the request clearly
matches its description.

For fast read-only queries with Pi's currently configured provider, use the
generic launcher. It disables discovery and write tools and loads the compact
shared query protocol:

```bash
./scripts/pi-wiki-query
```

For DS4, the provider-specific launcher additionally creates an isolated Pi
state directory and pins the local model settings:

```bash
./scripts/pi-ds4-wiki-query
```

Set `PI_CLI`, `DS4_BASE_URL`, or `LLM_WIKI_PI_DS4_STATE_DIR` only when your
local setup differs from the defaults. Both launchers accept `--dry-run` to
show the exact command. The equivalent generic Pi settings are:

```bash
pi \
  --append-system-prompt path/to/llm-wiki/profiles/query-lite/SKILL.md \
  --tools read,grep,find,ls \
  --no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-themes
```

The DS4 query profile is intentionally unable to write. Switch to the full
skill for ingest, research, compile, lint, or other mutating workflows. See
[`profiles/ds4/README.md`](profiles/ds4/README.md) and the reproducible
[`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md) DS4 lane.

**Any LLM Agent** (portable instruction file):
```bash
# Read-only queries: small default
cp profiles/query-lite/SKILL.md ~/your-project/AGENTS.md

# Research and maintenance: complete protocol
cp AGENTS.md ~/your-project/AGENTS.md
```

The query-lite profile works with agents that can read and search files. The
root `AGENTS.md` contains the complete write-capable protocol for agents that
can also edit files and search the web.

## Claude-First, Multi-Runtime

Claude Code is the principal user. Keep one shared behavior layer and thin packaging layers per runtime:

- `claude-plugin/` is the primary distribution target and UX surface.
- `claude-plugin/skills/wiki-manager/` is the behavioral source of truth.
- `plugins/llm-wiki/skills/wiki/` is the generated Codex packaging target behind `@wiki`.
- `claude-plugin/skills/wiki-manager/references/query-lite.md` is the canonical read-only query protocol.
- `profiles/query-lite/SKILL.md` and generated `wiki-query` skills expose that protocol without the full research context.
- `plugins/llm-wiki-opencode/` is the OpenCode and Pi packaging target.
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` makes the Codex plugin installable from this repo.
- `AGENTS.md` is the portable single-file protocol for any other LLM agent.

**Query and research presets:**

| Client | Read-only query path | Full research path | Validation |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Claude Code | `/wiki:query` command plus shared query protocol | Native plugin skill and commands | Deterministic fixtures plus live Sonnet/Opus runs |
| Codex | Explicit-only `$wiki-query` (~2.8 KB) | `@wiki` (~11.7 KB before lazy references) | Deterministic fixtures plus app-server live runs |
| Pi / DS4 | `scripts/pi-wiki-query`, or the isolated DS4 launcher, with read-only tools (~2.8 KB profile) | `pi --skill .../wiki-manager/SKILL.md` | Deterministic fixtures plus exact DS4 provider-payload measurement |
| OpenCode | `wiki-query/SKILL.md` (~2.8 KB) | `wiki-manager/SKILL.md` (~25.2 KB) | Static budgets and generated-package sync; live model is best effort |
| Any agent | Copy `profiles/query-lite/SKILL.md` (~2.8 KB) | Copy root `AGENTS.md` (~51.2 KB) | Static budgets |

Sizes are checked-in UTF-8 bytes, not provider token estimates. Use query mode
for lookups, evidence checks, lists, and inventory status. Use the full profile
for research, ingestion, compilation, lint fixes, or any workflow that writes.

Both runtime mirrors are generated, not hand-maintained. Rebuild from the Claude source of truth:

```bash
./scripts/sync-codex-plugin.sh      # regenerates plugins/llm-wiki/
./scripts/sync-opencode-plugin.sh   # regenerates plugins/llm-wiki-opencode/
./scripts/sync-query-lite-profile.sh # regenerates profiles/query-lite/
```

Each sync script:

- copies `claude-plugin/skills/wiki-manager/SKILL.md` into the target tree and reapplies a small list of runtime-specific wording patches
- copies `references/` from the Claude source — references are runtime-neutral and shared verbatim (previously a symlink, now a real copy so Codex marketplace caching works)
- generates compact `wiki-query` packages from the canonical query-lite reference
- (Codex only) recreates `agents/openai.yaml` for Codex UI metadata and syncs the plugin version

Drift is caught by `./tests/test-codex-sync.sh` and `./tests/test-opencode-sync.sh`, which run the sync scripts and fail (with self-healing fix instructions) if the generated directories differ from `HEAD`.

Practical rule: design workflows first for Claude commands and behavior, but keep the underlying knowledge model and references runtime-neutral. Runtime wrappers adapt invocation and metadata, not wiki logic.

## Nono Sandbox Permissions

If you run any AI coding agent inside a [nono](https://github.com/always-further/nono) sandbox, the wiki needs filesystem access beyond the default profile.

### Claude Code / OpenCode

```json
{
  "extends": "claude-code",
  "policy": {
    "add_allow_read": [
      "$HOME/.config/llm-wiki"
    ],
    "add_allow_readwrite": [
      "$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/wiki"
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `"extends": "claude-code"` with `"opencode"` for OpenCode.

### Codex

Codex needs r+w to its own `$HOME/.codex` directory for plugin install, marketplace cache, state, and skill registration:

```json
{
  "extends": "codex",
  "policy": {
    "add_allow_read": [
      "$HOME/.config/llm-wiki"
    ],
    "add_allow_readwrite": [
      "$HOME/.codex",
      "$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/wiki"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Path reference

| Path | Access | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `$HOME/.config/llm-wiki` | read | Hub path config — checked first during resolution (v0.4.2+) |
| Wiki data dir | readwrite | The wiki itself — use the actual path, not `$HOME/wiki` (see below) |
| `$HOME/.codex` | readwrite | Codex only — plugin cache, skills, state, marketplace temp files |

### Hub resolution and `~/wiki`

Hub resolution checks `~/.config/llm-wiki/config.json` first and only falls back to `~/wiki` when no config exists. If your wiki lives on iCloud or any non-default path, set the config and you don't need `$HOME/wiki` in the sandbox at all:

```bash
# Set once — agents will resolve from config, never touch ~/wiki
/wiki config hub-path "~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/wiki"
```

Use a portable `hub_path` with `~` for iCloud-shared hubs. Older configs may
contain `resolved_path`; llm-wiki treats it as a fallback cache because an
absolute `/Users/<name>/...` path from one Mac will not be valid on another.
The shared `wikis.json` should likewise store hub topic paths as
`topics/<slug>`, not absolute user-home paths.

If you prefer `~/wiki` as a symlink to iCloud, nono's Seatbelt follows symlinks — the target path must be allowed, not the symlink itself.

### Diagnosing access issues

Without the right permissions, Seatbelt or macOS privacy controls can block file
access. A useful diagnostic pattern is: `stat` succeeds for the iCloud wiki path,
but reading `wikis.json` or listing `topics/` fails with `Operation not
permitted`. That means the configured `hub_path` is correct; grant Full Disk
Access or iCloud Drive access to the exact app launching the agent, restart it,
and do not switch to a machine-local `resolved_path` or `~/wiki` fallback. Use
`nono why` to diagnose sandbox rules:

```bash
nono why --path ~/.config/llm-wiki --op read
nono why --path ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/wiki --op readwrite
```

**OpenCode** also needs the `external_directory` permission in `opencode.json` (see [Install](#install)) — nono and OpenCode have independent sandboxes that both need the same paths allowed.

## Upgrade

Agents and sandboxed sessions should use GitHub CLI web login with HTTPS git
transport, not SSH. This avoids SSH host-key prompts and `known_hosts` writes
inside nono:

```bash
gh auth login --web --git-protocol https
gh auth setup-git
```

**Claude Code** — if `claude plugin update` pulls the latest correctly:
```bash
git -C ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/llm-wiki remote set-url origin https://github.com/nvk/llm-wiki.git
claude plugin update wiki@llm-wiki
# Restart Claude Code to apply
```

If the update command doesn't pick up the new version (stale marketplace cache), sync manually from the repo:
```bash
# Clone or pull the latest
git clone https://github.com/nvk/llm-wiki.git  # or: git -C ~/llm-wiki pull

# Sync plugin files to Claude Code's plugin cache
REPO=~/llm-wiki/claude-plugin
DEST=~/.claude/plugins/cache/llm-wiki/wiki
VERSION=$(grep '"version"' "$REPO/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
rm -rf "$DEST"/*
mkdir -p "$DEST/$VERSION"
cp -R "$REPO/.claude-plugin" "$REPO/commands" "$REPO/skills" "$DEST/$VERSION/"

# Restart Claude Code to apply
```

**Codex** — upgrade from the marketplace:
```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade llm-wiki
codex plugin add wiki@llm-wiki
```

**OpenCode** — if using the GitHub URL in `instructions`, updates are automatic (fetched every session). If using a local copy:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvk/llm-wiki/master/plugins/llm-wiki-opencode/skills/wiki-manager/SKILL.md > ~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md
```

**AGENTS.md** — just pull the latest and replace:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvk/llm-wiki/master/AGENTS.md > ~/your-project/AGENTS.md
```

Check your installed version:
- Claude Code: look for the version in `/wiki` status output or check `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`
- Codex: run `./scripts/verify-codex-plugin.sh --scope user` and confirm the installed cache path and marketplace source match this repo

When working from this repository checkout, you can also run deterministic
checks without an agent:

```bash
./scripts/llm-wiki lint /path/to/wiki
./scripts/llm-wiki lint --fix /path/to/wiki
./scripts/llm-wiki schema status /path/to/wiki
./scripts/llm-wiki schema adopt /path/to/wiki          # add starter topic guide
./scripts/llm-wiki schema adopt --dry-run /path/to/wiki # preview without writing
./scripts/llm-wiki archive --hub /path/to/hub topic old-interest --reason "No longer active"
./scripts/llm-wiki archive --hub /path/to/hub list --archived
./scripts/llm-wiki archive --hub /path/to/hub restore old-interest
./scripts/llm-wiki-session --hub /path/to/hub status
./scripts/llm-wiki-session --hub /path/to/hub disable   # optional opt-out
./scripts/llm-wiki-session --hub /path/to/hub enable --mode balanced --tool-events 50
./scripts/llm-wiki-session --hub /path/to/hub rehydrate --cwd "$PWD"
./scripts/llm-wiki-session --hub /path/to/hub feedback list --unpromoted
./scripts/llm-wiki adapter add /private/adapter --read-root /private/input --write-root /private/results
./scripts/llm-wiki adapter doctor <id>
./scripts/llm-wiki adapter run <id> --request /absolute/request.json --json
./scripts/llm-wiki adapter run <id> --request /absolute/apply.json \
  --response /private/results/receipt.json \
  --approve-remote-write <plan-sha256> --json
```

This local helper covers structural checks and safe migrations that do not
require an LLM. The agentic `/wiki:lint` workflow remains the full protocol for
editorial and deep verification passes. The local schema helper creates only a
starter advisory topic guide (`schema.md`); run librarian conventions advice
for established wikis before adopting topic-specific vocabulary. The local archive helper
performs the deterministic folder move plus `wikis.json`, hub index, and log
updates.

## Session Memory

Long agent runs can lose useful context when a chat compacts, a terminal closes,
or work moves between runtimes. LLM Wiki keeps a separate operational-memory
layer under `HUB/.sessions/` (or `.wiki/.sessions/` for a local wiki) so a later
turn can recover the thread without copying full transcripts into the knowledge
base.

| Feature | How it works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Capture** | Trusted hooks use balanced mode by default. They record harness metadata, current directory and Git context, small redacted events, per-session state, and Markdown digests. Full transcript bodies are not stored by default. |
| **Session ID** | An ID such as `codex:abc123` combines the harness name with that runtime's native session ID. It is a local lookup key—not a secret, transcript, wiki, or topic ID. |
| **Rehydrate** | `/wiki:session rehydrate` returns a compact context block and pointers to matching digests instead of bulk-pasting chat history. |
| **Feedback** | High-signal corrections, preferences, approvals, and plan acceptance become reviewable candidates under `.sessions/feedback/`; generic acknowledgements are ignored. |
| **Promote** | Digests and feedback remain operational memory until an explicit `promote` writes a distilled note to a topic's `raw/notes/`. Only then can normal compilation turn it into topic knowledge. |
| **Opt out** | `/wiki:session disable` makes trusted capture hooks no-ops; `/wiki:session enable` turns capture back on. |

```text
/wiki:session status
/wiki:session list --limit 10
/wiki:session show codex:abc123
/wiki:session rehydrate --cwd "$PWD"
/wiki:session promote codex:abc123 --topic meta-llm-wiki
/wiki:feedback list --unpromoted
/wiki:feedback promote fb-abc123 --topic meta-llm-wiki
```

This harness-session layer is distinct from `.research-session.json` and
`.thesis-session.json` crash recovery, and from `.session-events.jsonl` and
`.session-checkpoint.json` workflow provenance. See the
[session reference](claude-plugin/skills/wiki-manager/references/sessions.md)
for the storage layout, privacy defaults, capture modes, and adapter contract.

All commands accept `--wiki <name>` to target a specific topic wiki and `--local` to target the project wiki. Archived topic wikis are skipped by default; commands that support `--include-archived` require that explicit flag before reading or writing archived material. Retraction is the exception: an explicitly selected archived target needs no additional gate, and `scripts/llm-wiki retract --everywhere` includes archives and session context. Commands that generate content (`query`, `output`, `plan`) also accept `--with <wiki>` to load supplementary wikis as cross-wiki context — e.g., `--with article-writing` applies writing craft knowledge when generating output from a domain wiki.

`/wiki:librarian` is the focused wiki-maintenance tool. `/wiki:audit` is broader and may perform fresh research to decide whether the current knowledge or generated outputs are still trustworthy.

## How It Works

    └── ...
```

The hub is just a registry — no content directories, no `.obsidian/`. All content lives in topic sub-wikis with isolated indexes, articles, and a human-owned advisory topic guide (`schema.md`). Init creates the core wiki skeleton first; optional inventory and dataset layers are created when you use them. Queries stay focused. The multi-wiki peek finds overlap across topics when relevant.

### The Flow

1. **Research** a topic — parallel agents search the web, ingest sources, and compile articles in one command
2. **Ingest** additional sources — URLs, files, text, tweets (via Grok MCP), or bulk via inbox
3. **Collect** catalogs of discoverable things — examples, media, memes, tools, projects, entities, or source candidates — then optionally inventory them
4. **Inventory** items, candidates, entities, corpora, watch lists, and next actions that should persist; the agent tells you when inventory is the wrong layer
5. **Develop Ideas** from rough seed to researched, challenged, approved shape, then explicitly promote them into delivery Projects
6. **Index datasets** that are too large for markdown — manifests, profiles, samples, and query recipes
7. **Archive** whole topic wikis that should stay preserved but quiet
8. **Compile** raw sources into synthesized wiki articles with cross-references and confidence scores
9. **Query** the wiki — quick (indexes), standard (articles), or deep (everything active, archived indexes separated)
10. **Session capture** — automatically preserve redacted Codex/Claude/OpenCode/Gemini checkpoints under `.sessions/` and rehydrate future turns
11. **Feedback curator** — capture reviewable correction/preference/approval candidates under `.sessions/feedback/` and promote only what matters
12. **Lessons learned** — extract knowledge from the current session (errors, fixes, gotchas) into the wiki
13. **Assess** a repo against the wiki — gap analysis: what aligns, what's missing, what the market offers
14. **Lint** for consistency — broken links, missing indexes, orphan articles, archive registry drift
15. **Output** artifacts — summaries, reports, slides — filed back into the wiki

### Key Design

- **One topic, one wiki** — each research area gets its own sub-wiki with isolated indexes. No cross-topic noise.
- **Canonical collection slugs** — collection families use kind-first topic
  names such as `memes-bitcoin`, `memes-ethereum`, or `tools-bitcoin` so
  related catalogs group naturally as the hub grows.
- **Parallel research agents** — 5 standard, 8 deep, 10 retardmax. Each agent searches from a different angle.
- **Collector workflow** — search-driven catalogs for objects, media, and
  examples; saves a provenance map first, then inventories only the durable
  subset.
- **Concept → Idea → Project** — compiled Concepts hold knowledge, cataloged
  Ideas hold researched/shaped proposals, and Projects begin only after
  explicit delivery commitment. Natural language routes the whole lifecycle.
- **Hub-wide portfolio** — one live, read-only view cross-references distributed
  Ideas and direct/promoted Projects without duplicating topic-owned records.
- **`_index.md` navigation** — every existing wiki-managed directory has an index. Claude reads indexes first, never scans blindly.
- **Articles are synthesized**, not copied — they explain, contextualize, cross-reference.
- **Raw is immutable in normal workflows** — explicit user-directed retraction is the exception and removes selected raw and derived references.
- **Multi-wiki aware** — queries peek at sibling wiki indexes for overlap.
- **Archive-aware** — archived topic wikis stay preserved under
  `topics/.archive/` but are hidden from default query/compile/research/collect/output
  and maintenance workflows.
- **Dual-linking** — both `[[wikilinks]]` (Obsidian) and standard markdown links on every cross-reference. Works everywhere.
- **Confidence scoring** — articles rated high/medium/low based on source quality and corroboration.
- **Structural guardian** — auto-checks wiki integrity after operations, fixes trivial issues silently.
- **Activity log** — `log.md` tracks every operation, append-only, grep-friendly.
- **Opinionated inventory** — durable tracking gets records; one-off sources stay
  ingest/query; large row-like data becomes datasets or collection ingests. Big
  pivots start with a sample table before records are written.
- **Media-safe catalogs** — bounded public binary media is cached under
  `output/assets/collect-<slug>/` by default; raw sources remain textual
  evidence, and large media sets become dataset manifests. Bulk downloads use
  timeouts, file-size caps, content-type checks, and IPv4 retry when needed.
- **Feedback is candidate memory** — corrections, preferences, approvals, and
  plan acceptance are saved as redacted candidates under `.sessions/feedback/`;
  generic acknowledgements are ignored, and promotion into topic notes is
  explicit.
- **Zero dependencies** — runs entirely on built-in tools (Claude Code, OpenCode, or Codex).

## Research Modes

| Mode | Flag | Agents | Style |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Standard | *(default)* | 5 | Academic, technical, applied, news, contrarian |
| Deep | `--deep` | 8 | Adds historical, adjacent fields, data/stats |
| Retardmax | `--retardmax` | 10 | Adds rabbit-hole agents. Skip planning, cast widest net, ingest aggressively, compile fast. Lint later. |

**Smart input detection** — `/wiki:research` auto-detects whether you're passing a topic or a question:

| Input | Detected as | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `"nutrition"` | Topic | Standard research — explore the field |
| `"What makes articles go viral?"` | Question | Decompose into sub-questions → one agent per sub-question → synthesize → generate playbook → suggest theses |

Question mode produces a **playbook** (actionable output artifact) and suggests **testable theses** derived from the findings.

**Modifiers** (combine with any mode):

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--new-topic` | Create a topic wiki from the research topic and start immediately. Works from any directory. |
| `--plan` | Decompose into 3-5 parallel research paths, confirm, then dispatch all paths simultaneously. Parallel ingest, sequential compile. |
| `--min-time <duration>` | Keep running research rounds until the time budget is spent (`30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`). Each round drills into gaps the previous round found. |
| `--sources <N>` | Sources per round (default: 5, retardmax: 15) |

```
# The full combo — new topic, 2 hours of deep research, from anywhere
/wiki:research "CRISPR gene therapy" --new-topic --deep --min-time 2h
```

Retardmax mode is inspired by [Elisha Long's retardmaxxing philosophy](https://www.retardmaxx.com/) — act first, think later. The antidote to analysis paralysis. Works for both `/wiki:research` and `/wiki:output`.

## Thesis-Driven Research

Unlike open-ended research, `/wiki:thesis` starts with a specific claim and evaluates it:

```
/wiki:thesis "intermittent fasting reduces neuroinflammation via glymphatic upregulation"
```

**How it works:**
1. Decomposes the thesis into key variables, testable predictions, and falsification criteria
2. Launches parallel agents — but each agent has the thesis as a FILTER. Irrelevant sources get skipped (this prevents bloat)
3. Agents are split: **supporting**, **opposing**, **mechanistic**, **meta/review**, **adjacent** — balanced by design
4. Compiles evidence into wiki articles + a thesis file with evidence tables
5. Delivers a **verdict**: supported / partially supported / contradicted / insufficient evidence / mixed

**Anti-confirmation-bias**: When using `--min-time`, Round 2 automatically focuses harder on the WEAKER side of the evidence. If Round 1 found mostly supporting evidence, Round 2 hunts for counter-evidence.

**The thesis is the bloat filter.** Sources that don't relate to the claim's variables don't get ingested. Higher skip rate = tighter focus.

## Linking: Works Everywhere

Every cross-reference in the wiki uses dual-link format:

```markdown
[[gut-brain-axis|Gut-Brain Axis]] ([Gut-Brain Axis](../concepts/gut-brain-axis.md))
```

The wiki is **not locked into any tool**:

- **Obsidian** reads the `[[wikilink]]` — graph view, backlinks panel, quick-open
- **Claude Code** follows the standard `(relative/path.md)` link
- **GitHub/any markdown viewer** renders the standard link as clickable
- **No viewer at all** — plain markdown, readable in any text editor

## Obsidian Integration

Each topic wiki has its own `.obsidian/` config and can be opened as an independent vault:

```
open ~/wiki/topics/nutrition/     # Open in Obsidian — focused graph for one topic
```

The hub (`~/wiki/`) has no `.obsidian/` to avoid nested vault confusion. If you want a cross-topic view, open `~/wiki/` manually and let Obsidian create its own config.

What works out of the box:

- `.obsidian/` config can be created on init with sane defaults
- `[[wikilinks]]` power the graph view
- `aliases` in frontmatter enable search by alternate names
- `tags` in frontmatter are natively read
- `inbox/` works as a drop zone in both Obsidian and the CLI

Claude Code is the compiler. Obsidian is an optional viewer.

## Query Depths

| Depth | Flag | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Quick | `--quick` | Reads indexes only. Fastest. For simple lookups. |
| Standard | *(default)* | Reads relevant articles + full-text search. For most questions. |
| Deep | `--deep` | Reads everything active, searches raw sources, peeks sibling wikis, and surfaces archived index matches separately. |
| List | `--list` | Returns ranked article list instead of synthesized answer. Supports `--tag` and `--category` filters. |

Archived topics are excluded from quick, standard, and list results unless you
pass `--include-archived`. Deep mode may show archived index hits, but it does
not cite archived material as active evidence without explicit inclusion.

## Development Benchmarks

Token-efficiency changes are tested with deterministic context budgets and
optional real Codex and Claude Code AB/BA harnesses. See
[`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md) for commands, quality gates, and
cache-metric caveats.
