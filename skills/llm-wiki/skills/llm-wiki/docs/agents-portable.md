# LLM Wiki — Agent Instructions

> This is an "idea file" in the spirit of [Karpathy's LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f). Paste it into any LLM agent (OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini Code Assist, or similar) and it will build and manage a wiki for you. The agent customizes the specifics; this file communicates the system.

> **Editing the llm-wiki repo itself?** This file is the portable wiki *protocol* for end users. The dev contract for the plugin codebase (testing, sync workflow, project structure, symlink invariant) lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — read it in addition to this file. Both Claude Code and Codex agents working on the repo should treat `CLAUDE.md` as the source of truth for repo-level workflow.

## What This Is

An LLM-compiled knowledge base. You (the LLM agent) are both the compiler and the query engine. Raw source documents are ingested, then incrementally compiled into a wiki of interconnected markdown articles. The human rarely edits the wiki directly — that's your domain.

**The metaphor**: raw sources are source code, you are the compiler, the wiki is the executable.

## Architecture

### Hub Path

Defaults to `~/wiki/`. Optionally configured via `~/.config/llm-wiki/config.json`:

```json
{ "hub_path": "~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/wiki" }
```

If the config exists, prefer `hub_path` (expand only the leading `~`) instead of
`~/wiki/` everywhere below. Treat `resolved_path` from older configs as a
machine-specific fallback cache, not as the source of truth; do not write it
into shared configs. If the path can be statted but reading `wikis.json` or
listing `topics/` fails with `Operation not permitted`, the path is correct and
macOS/iCloud privacy is blocking the launcher; ask the user to grant Full Disk
Access or iCloud Drive access and restart, rather than falling back to another
machine path. Store the selected path as **HUB**. Use
`/wiki config hub-path <path>` to set it up, or create the JSON manually.

### Hub (~/wiki/)

The hub is lightweight — NO content, just a registry.

```
~/wiki/                         # or custom path from config.json
├── wikis.json          # Registry of all topic wikis

```

### Topic Wiki (~/wiki/topics/<name>/)

### Local Wiki (.wiki/)

Same structure as a topic wiki but at `<project>/.wiki/`. Add `.wiki/` to `.gitignore`.

## Core Principles

1. **One topic, one wiki.** Never mix unrelated topics. The hub is just a registry.
   For collection families that can grow across subjects, prefer kind-first
   topic slugs such as `memes-bitcoin`, `memes-ethereum`, `tools-bitcoin`, or
   `examples-seedqr`. Use subject-first slugs when the subject is the primary
   research area and the collection is only one artifact within that topic.
2. **Indexes are navigation.** Every existing wiki-managed directory has `_index.md` with a contents table. Read indexes first, never scan blindly. Keep them current. Optional layers do not need placeholder indexes before they exist.
3. **Raw is immutable.** Once ingested, sources are never modified. All synthesis happens in `wiki/`. Explicit retraction is the exception.
4. **Articles are synthesized, not copied.** Draw from multiple sources, contextualize, connect. Think textbook, not clipboard.
5. **Dual-linking.** Every cross-reference uses both formats on the same line: `[[slug|Name]] ([Name](../category/slug.md))`. Obsidian reads the wikilink, the agent reads the markdown link, GitHub renders it. Not locked into any tool.
6. **Incremental by default.** Only compile new sources unless explicitly asked for full recompile.
7. **Honest gaps.** If the wiki doesn't have the answer, say so. Suggest what to ingest.
8. **Multi-wiki peek.** When querying, answer from the target wiki, then peek at sibling wiki `_index.md` files for overlap.
9. **Confidence scoring.** Articles get `confidence: high|medium|low` in frontmatter based on source quality.
10. **Archive is quiet preservation.** Archived topic wikis move to
`HUB/topics/.archive/<slug>/`, remain structurally maintainable, and stay out of
normal query/compile/research/collect/output context unless explicitly included. Deep
queries may surface archived index matches separately.
11. **Activity log.** Append every operation to `log.md`. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | Description`. Never edit existing entries.
12. **Session capture is operational memory.** Automated harness-session capture lives under `HUB/.sessions/` or `.wiki/.sessions/`. It can preserve redacted checkpoints automatically, but topic wiki promotion is explicit and user-directed. Feedback candidates live under `.sessions/feedback/` and capture only high-signal corrections, preferences, approvals, or plan acceptance; generic acknowledgements are ignored.
13. **Private adapters are content-free external tools.** Executable
registrations live in the machine-local `~/.config/llm-wiki/adapters.json`,
never in `wikis.json` or a topic wiki. Adapter repositories contain code,
manifests, docs, tests, and synthetic fixtures only; real inputs and runtime
outputs stay in separately controlled external data planes. Only reviewed
`wiki-safe` candidates may be promoted through normal provenance workflows.
14. **Remote writes fail closed.** Register exact remote resources, require
declared remote effects, bind explicit approval to the exact plan hash and
expected revision, use a caller-stable idempotency key, and require a private
read-back-verified receipt. A request file alone is never approval.
15. **Route external actions before ingestion.** For an action plus URL, run
`adapter route` first. A healthy match hands off to the adapter-owned guide;
provider steps stay private.

## File Formats

### _index.md (every existing wiki-managed directory)

```markdown
# [Directory Name] Index

> [One-line description]

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Contents

| File | Summary | Tags | Updated |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| [file.md](file.md) | One-sentence summary | tag1, tag2 | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Categories

- **category**: file1.md, file2.md

## Recent Changes

- YYYY-MM-DD: Description
```

Master `_index.md` additionally has Statistics and Quick Navigation sections.

### Topic Guide (`schema.md`)

```yaml
---
title: "Topic Guide"
schema_state: advisory
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
summary: "Human-owned topic guide for local vocabulary and conventions."
---
```

`schema.md` is a **topic guide**, not a database schema. It is human-owned and
default for topic wikis. It may define topic-local entity types, relationship
verbs, article subtypes, source conventions, and inventory/dataset boundaries.
It must not redefine global llm-wiki primitives such as raw source folders,
article categories, inventory kinds, or required frontmatter.
`schema_state: advisory` means suggestions only. `strict` is advanced explicit
opt-in and still never permits automatic article rewrites.

Existing wikis without `schema.md` are valid. Adopt a starter guide with
`llm-wiki schema adopt`, or run a librarian conventions pass first for
established wikis and copy only the useful proposal parts into `schema.md`.

### Raw Source (raw/)

```yaml
---
title: "Title"
source: "URL or filepath or MANUAL"
type: articles|papers|repos|notes|data
ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
summary: "2-3 sentence summary"
---
```

### Wiki Article (wiki/)

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
category: concept|topic|reference
sources: [raw/type/file1.md, raw/type/file2.md]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
aliases: [alternate names]
confidence: high|medium|low
summary: "2-3 sentence summary"
---
```

Body includes abstract, sections, `## See Also` (dual-links, bidirectional), `## Sources` (links to raw/).

### Inventory Record (inventory/)

```yaml
---
title: "Thing To Track"
kind: item|idea|ingest-candidate|entity|corpus|question|task|artifact|watch
status: proposed|active|blocked|ingested|superseded|archived
priority: p0|p1|p2|p3|p4
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
summary: "Why this record exists"
sources:
  - output/original-output.md
---
```

Inventory records are durable wiki-adjacent tracking objects. They can point at
`raw/`, `wiki/`, `output/`, URLs, or external paths, but they do not move or copy
those artifacts. Local `sources:` paths and body links in inventory records
should resolve; lint checks them as operational provenance, not factual
evidence.

Inventory is opinionated. Use it when something should persist across sessions
with status, priority, ownership, or a next action. Actual physical/digital
items such as parts, tools, hosts, SKUs, subscriptions, and assets are good
fits when their owned/wanted/selected/rejected state matters. Deliverable Ideas
use `inventory/ideas/` until explicitly promoted. It is too small
for a one-off source to ingest now, a factual question, or a note with no future
action. It is too large for hundreds/thousands of row-like data records; use one
corpus record plus a dataset manifest or collection ingest instead. It is out of
scope for authoritative source text (`raw/`), synthesized knowledge (`wiki/`),
generated deliverables (`output/`), project rationale (`WHY.md`), or secrets.
For bigger pivots, show a 1-3 row sample of proposed records before asking to
apply.

### Inventory View (inventory/views/)

```yaml
---
title: "Active Inventory Actions"
view: actions
filters:
  status: active
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
summary: "Derived table of active inventory records with next actions."
---
```

Inventory views are derived list/table views, not inventory records. They should
link to records and may be regenerated from record frontmatter. Do not require
`kind`, `status`, or `priority` on view files.

### Dataset Manifest (datasets/)

```yaml
---
title: "Dataset Title"
dataset_id: dataset-slug
status: proposed|active|external|archived|unavailable
storage: local|remote|external|hybrid
locations: ["/path/or/url"]
formats: [csv, jsonl, parquet]
schema_status: unknown|inferred|declared|validated
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
summary: "What this dataset contains and why the wiki indexes it"
---
```

Dataset manifests let the wiki serve as an index/interface for data that is too
large or unsuitable to store in markdown. Store locations, schema notes, small
samples, profiles, and query recipes; never copy the underlying dataset into the
wiki.

Be opinionated about the boundary: small stable data belongs in `raw/data/`;
large, mutable, remote, compressed, binary, or query-oriented data belongs in
`datasets/`; next-action tracking belongs in linked inventory records; many
independent source pages belong in `ingest-collection`.

### Source Reference Resolution

Treat `sources:` entries as exact paths first, not whitespace-delimited slugs.
Parse them as YAML list scalars; if falling back to line parsing, preserve the
complete value after `- ` and strip only matching wrapping quotes. Resolve
`raw/...`, `wiki/...`, and `output/...` from the wiki root; resolve `../...`
relative to the file that owns the `sources:` field. If exact resolution fails,
slugify both the requested value and raw-file stems (lowercase, whitespace or
underscores to hyphens, remove other special characters, collapse hyphens; also
try raw stems with a leading `YYYY-MM-DD-` stripped) and accept only a single
match. Report zero matches as unresolved and multiple matches as ambiguous.
Never rename raw files during resolution. When linking to raw filenames with
spaces in markdown, use angle-bracket destinations:
`[Title](<../../raw/articles/File Name.md>)`.

### wikis.json

```json
{
  "default": "<HUB>",
  "wikis": {
    "hub": { "path": "<HUB>", "description": "Hub" },
    "<name>": { "path": "topics/<name>", "description": "...", "status": "active" },
    "<archived-name>": {
      "path": "topics/.archive/<archived-name>",
      "description": "...",
      "status": "archived",
      "archived": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "archive_reason": "optional"
    }
  },
  "local_wikis": []
}
```

Resolve `wikis.json` paths as `<HUB>`, leading `~`, absolute, or relative to
HUB. For topic wikis inside the shared hub, store portable relative paths like
`topics/<name>`, not `/Users/<name>/...` absolute paths; absolute user-home
paths break when an iCloud wiki is opened from another Mac. If a registry path
is stale but `HUB/topics/<name>/_index.md` exists, use that topic path and
repair the registry on the next sync.

Archived topic wikis use portable paths under `topics/.archive/<name>` and
`status: archived`. Normal tools skip these entries unless the user explicitly
asks for archived content or structural maintenance.

### log.md

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | Description
```

Operations: `init`, `ingest`, `ingest-collection`, `compile`, `query`, `lint`, `research`, `thesis`, `collect`, `output`, `assess`, `refresh`, `librarian`, `audit`, `plan`, `idea`, `project`, `inventory`, `dataset`, `schema`, `archive`, `ll`

## Operations

### Init

Create a topic wiki. Always require a topic name. If the hub doesn't exist,
create it first (just wikis.json + _index.md + log.md + topics/). Refuse to
create a new active topic over an existing `HUB/topics/<slug>` or
`HUB/topics/.archive/<slug>`; if an archived topic has the requested slug, ask
whether to restore it or choose a different slug. Create the core topic wiki
structure, empty `_index.md` files for created directories, config.md, log.md,
schema.md, and optionally .obsidian/ vault config. Create `inventory/`, `datasets/`, and
per-dataset sample/profile/query folders lazily when those commands need them.
Start `schema.md` as a human-owned topic guide in `schema_state: advisory` with a small default vocabulary;
the human can trim it later and opt into strict mode only explicitly.

### Ingest

Convert external material into a raw source file.

- **URLs**: Fetch content, extract title/author/date/text, write to `raw/articles/` or `raw/papers/`; download PDF URLs and run PDF extraction
- **Files**: Read directly, preserve formatting; convert PDFs to markdown when possible
- **Text**: User provides quoted text, write to `raw/notes/`
- **Inbox**: Scan `inbox/` for dumped files, process each by type, move to `inbox/.processed/`

Auto-detect type: arxiv/scholar/PDF papers → papers, github → repos, .csv/.json → data, everything else → articles.

PDFs are single-source ingests. Try `pdftotext -layout` only if local poppler is
working and produces non-trivial text; otherwise use a temporary Python venv
with a PDF library such as `pypdf` or `pymupdf`. Preserve page boundaries when
available. If the PDF is image-only and no OCR path is available, write a
metadata stub with `extraction_status: ocr-needed` rather than inventing text.

**Auto-classify** (when no `--wiki` specified): After fetching content, match against topic wiki scopes. Single items get a numbered choice (pick wiki, create new, or skip). Batch/inbox mode presents a classification table for bulk routing. Skipped when `--wiki` or `--local` is explicit.

Slug: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md`. Update all indexes after each ingestion. If 5+ uncompiled sources, suggest compilation.

If the user wants to track or decide later about a source, use inventory instead
of ingesting immediately. If a source is large or query-oriented, use a dataset
manifest or collection ingest. After ingesting a tracked candidate, suggest
linking the raw path from the inventory record.

### Ingest Collection

Bulk-ingest bounded upstream corpora without turning them directly into compiled
wiki articles. Use this for Git document repositories, BIP-style proposal sets,
MediaWiki XML dumps/API sites, CSV/JSON message archives, and Wayback CDX
snapshot sets. Never recursively crawl HTML; use structured upstream
interfaces.

Adapters:
- **git**: clone shallowly or read a local repo; inventory text files with blob
  SHAs and HEAD commit. For BIP-style repos, prioritize `bip-####.mediawiki`
  and `bip-####.md`, parse proposal headers, and store each proposal as a child
  raw source.
- **mediawiki-dump**: read official `.xml`, `.xml.bz2`, or `.xml.gz` dumps with
  streaming XML parsing; default to namespace 0; skip redirects and non-content
  namespaces unless explicitly included.
- **mediawiki-api**: use `api.php` with `allpages` and `revisions` for targeted
  imports or dumpless sites; follow continuation tokens and respect throttling.
- **csv-messages**: parse `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.json`, or `.jsonl` message archives
  with Python stdlib; infer id/date/author/subject/body fields; write one raw
  markdown source per message, usually under `raw/notes/`.
- **wayback-cdx**: use Internet Archive CDX as the bounded inventory; fetch
  selected captures with `id_` replay URLs; run readability-to-markdown; write
  one raw article per readable snapshot.

Every collection import writes a manifest to `raw/repos/` tagged
`collection-manifest`, plus one immutable child source per upstream page/spec in
`raw/articles/` unless another type is more appropriate. Child frontmatter may
include `collection`, `adapter`, `upstream_id`, `upstream_type`, `revision`,
`sha`, `canonical_url`, `content_format`, `license`, `authors`, `categories`,
`outlinks`, `fetched`, and adapter-specific provenance such as `message_id`,
`row_number`, `wayback_timestamp`, or `wayback_digest`. Deduplicate by
`collection + upstream_id + revision/sha` or the adapter's stable row/snapshot
key; if upstream content changes, write a new raw source instead of overwriting
the old one.

Compile collections selectively: synthesize concepts, topics, timelines,
glossaries, standards families, and reference indexes. Do not create one
compiled wiki article per upstream page by default. For BIPs, publication is
provenance for proposal text, not proof of adoption or consensus. For community
wikis, default confidence to medium unless corroborated by stronger sources.

### Private Adapters

Private adapters are explicitly trusted local executables implementing
`llm-wiki-adapter/v1`. They are distinct from the fixed collection-ingestion
adapter modes above.

For an action plus URL, run `llm-wiki adapter route --intent <effect>
--resource <url> --json` before ingestion. A match returns the adapter guide;
read it and run `adapter doctor`. No-match resumes normal routing; ambiguity or
drift fails closed.

Use the bundled `bin/llm-wiki` from the installed plugin root, or
`scripts/llm-wiki` in a source checkout:

```bash
llm-wiki adapter add /private/adapter \
  --read-root /private/input \
  --write-root /private/results
llm-wiki adapter list
llm-wiki adapter route --intent edit --resource '<external-url>' --json
llm-wiki adapter doctor <id>
llm-wiki adapter run <id> --request /absolute/request.json --json
llm-wiki adapter remove <id> --yes
```

Each adapter root contains `.llm-wiki-adapter.json` with a protocol, id,
version, argv entrypoint, capabilities, operations, network declaration,
`writes_wiki: false`, and output classes. The entrypoint implements `describe`
and `execute --request <path> --response <path>`.

Private adapter repositories are named
`llm-wiki-adapter-<domain>-<capability>`. Their stable manifest id is the
suffix portion `<domain>-<capability>`. Adapter repositories are tools only:
never commit real content, case configuration, corpora, captures, documents,
recordings, transcripts, indexes, credentials, results, evidence packets, or
source-specific identifiers, even when the repository is private.

The local registry is mode `0600`, stores environment-variable names but never
their values, and scopes adapter input/output paths. Execution uses an argv
array without a shell, checks manifest drift, applies timeouts, validates paths,
and verifies returned artifact hashes. llm-wiki never clones or updates adapter
repos and never imports run output automatically.

After a run, inspect only `wiki-safe` candidates. Keep `private` and `bulk`
artifacts external. Review provenance and privacy before writing the smallest
useful raw note or evidence packet and compiling bounded conclusions. A
`wiki-safe` label is a review hint, not proof that publication is appropriate.

For large imports, preview the collection manifest shape and estimated child
count first. If the user only wants to remember the corpus for later, create one
inventory record; if the corpus is row-like data, create a dataset manifest plus
one linked inventory record.

### Compile

Transform raw sources into wiki articles. Incremental by default (only new sources).

1. Survey: read indexes, identify uncompiled sources
2. Extract: key concepts, facts, relationships from each source
3. Map: which concepts need new articles vs updates to existing
4. Classify: concept (bounded idea), topic (broad theme), reference (curated list)
5. Write: synthesized articles with dual-links, frontmatter, confidence scores, aliases
6. Bidirectional links: if A links to B, ensure B links to A
7. Update all indexes

Do not compile inventory records as articles. They may explain priorities or
next actions, but factual article claims need raw/wiki sources.

Archived topics are skipped by default. If a target wiki is archived, require an
explicit archived include or restore it first. Compiling an archived target must
keep all writes inside that archived topic and must not make it active.

### Query

Answer questions from wiki content only. Three depths:

- **Quick**: Read indexes only. Fastest.
- **Standard** (default): Read relevant articles + full-text search. Follow See Also links.
- **Deep**: Read everything active, search raw sources, peek sibling wikis.

Always cite sources. Note confidence levels. Identify gaps. Never use training data — only wiki content.

Archived topic wikis are excluded from quick, standard, and list queries. Deep
queries may read archived sibling `_index.md` files and report a separate
Archived Matches section, but archived article bodies and raw sources are read
only when the user explicitly includes archived content. Label archived
citations clearly.

For meta-questions about inventory, candidates, backlogs, or next actions, read
inventory indexes and answer as an operational listing. For factual questions,
inventory is not evidence.

For any boot, resume, or "where you left off" briefing, start with the active
wiki identity: `<wiki-name> booted from <wiki-root-path>`. Prefer the title from
`config.md`; for local `.wiki/` projects, fall back to the parent directory name
(for example `bitcoin-wiki` for `.../claude-sandbox/bitcoin-wiki/.wiki`); for
`HUB/topics/<slug>/`, fall back to the slug. Include this line even when there
is nothing in flight to resume.

### Research

Automated pipeline: search → ingest → compile. Launch parallel agents. Auto-detects input type.

**Input detection**: If the input is a question (starts with what/why/how, contains "?", phrased as a goal), enters Question Mode. Otherwise, Topic Mode.

**Topic Mode** — explore a subject area:
- **Standard (5 agents)**: Academic, Technical, Applied, News/Trends, Contrarian
- **Deep (8 agents)**: Adds Historical, Adjacent fields, Data/Stats
- **Retardmax (10 agents)**: Adds 2 Rabbit Hole agents. Skip planning, ingest aggressively.

**Question Mode** — answer a specific question with a deliverable:
1. Decompose into 3-5 sub-questions (what/why/how/who/data)
2. One agent per sub-question (focused, not generic angles)
3. Compile into wiki articles + a synthesis "playbook" topic article
4. Auto-generate a playbook output artifact (the actionable deliverable)
5. Suggest 2-3 testable theses from findings → feed into `--mode thesis`

**Modifiers**: `--new-topic` (create wiki + research in one shot), `--plan` (decompose into 3-5 parallel paths, confirm, dispatch all at once — parallel ingest, sequential compile), `--mode thesis "<claim>"` (thesis-driven research with for/against framing and verdict), `--min-time <duration>` (sustained multi-round research), `--sources <N>` (per round).

Each agent receives a standardized prompt template: Objective, Context, Current wiki state, Constraints, Return format, Quality scoring guide (5=peer-reviewed → 1=spam). Deduplicate across agents.

**Phase 2b: Credibility Review** — after agents return, before ingestion: score each source on peer-review status (+2), recency (+1), author authority (+1), vendor primary source (-1), potential bias (-1), corroboration (+1 per agent, max +2). Tiers: High (4-6) → Medium (2-3) → Low (0-1) → Reject (<0). Bias signals do not stack.

**Session Files** (`--min-time` research, thesis, audit, refresh, output): use
two ephemeral files plus two durable files in the wiki root.

- *Ephemeral*: `.research-session.json` and `.thesis-session.json` track live
  round number, sources, articles, gaps, and progress score for crash recovery.
  Create at session start, update each round, delete on normal completion, and
  leave in place with `status: "in_progress"` if interrupted.
- *Durable*: `.session-events.jsonl` is an append-only event log, and
  `.session-checkpoint.json` is the latest summary/checkpoint. Both persist
  after normal completion; never delete them as routine cleanup.
- *Resume*: on a new invocation, check active ephemeral files first. If absent,
  read `.session-checkpoint.json` and the tail of `.session-events.jsonl` for
  durable context. Warn when files are older than 7 days before resuming.

**Progress Scoring**: Each round scored 0-100: sources×3 + articles×5 + cross-refs×2 + credibility×4. Trajectory triggers: 3 consecutive declines totaling 30+ points → warn. Score ≥80 + no gaps → early completion. Score <40 → change strategy.

**Plan Reflection**: Between rounds, reflect holistically on ALL prior findings (not just latest gaps). Priority: draw cross-topic connections → update cross-references → re-evaluate gaps → score remaining gaps (Impact × Feasibility × Specificity) → adjust direction only if clearly needed.

Compile all ingested sources. Report gaps and suggest follow-ups.

### Thesis (mode of Research)

Thesis-driven research. Activated via `--mode thesis "<claim>"` on the research command. Previously a separate `/wiki:thesis` command (merged to eliminate duplicated infrastructure).

1. Decompose thesis into: core claim, key variables, testable prediction, falsification criteria, scope boundary
2. Agents split by purpose: Supporting, Opposing, Mechanistic, Meta/Review, Adjacent (+ Historical, Quantitative, Confounders in deep mode)
3. The thesis is the bloat filter — sources irrelevant to the claim's variables get skipped
4. Compile evidence into wiki articles + a thesis file with evidence tables (for/against/nuance)
5. Verdict: Supported / Partially Supported / Contradicted / Insufficient Evidence / Mixed (with confidence level)
6. Anti-confirmation-bias: in `--min-time` mode, Round 2 focuses harder on the WEAKER side of Round 1's evidence
7. Suggest follow-up theses derived from findings

### Collect

Find, catalog, deduplicate, and optionally inventory bounded sets of
discoverable things: memes, examples, tools, projects, products, people,
companies, quotes, source candidates, media, or other artifacts where the list
itself is the deliverable.

Collect outputs are a provenance-rich discovery layer for the LLM: "I found
these things, with this context and confidence, but I have not yet decided what
they mean." Later workflows may promote selected context pages into `raw/`,
synthesize stable knowledge into `wiki/`, create durable tracking records in
`inventory/`, or index large media/data collections in `datasets/`.

Collect is distinct from research and collection ingest. Use research for an
answer, thesis, or synthesized article. Use ingest-collection for structured
upstream corpora such as Git repos, MediaWiki dumps/API sites, message archives,
or Wayback CDX inventories. Use collect when the user asks to find, gather,
catalog, curate, or inventory many objects. "All" means all discovered within
the stated strategy and limit, not the whole internet.

Scale is based on operational cost, not just row count:

| Scale | Rows | Source Shape | Default Behavior |
|-------|------|--------------|------------------|
| tiny | 1-3 | Known items | Skip collect; use ingest, query, or inventory directly |
| small | 4-25 | Discoverable with normal search | Write catalog output; per-item inventory allowed |
| medium | 26-100 | Open web or mixed sources | Write catalog output; inventory as one corpus record by default |
| large | 101-500 | Many candidates or unstable sources | Dry-run first; require confirmation |
| huge | 501+ | Structured corpus, dataset, archive, or large media set | Use dataset or ingest-collection |

Flow:
1. State the fit judgment: appropriate for collect, too source-like, too
   analytical, too operational, or too large.
2. Define scope, scale, media policy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, collection
   kind, tags, and a default cap.
3. Search several angles, fetch only promising pages, and prefer provenance-rich
   sources such as original posts, creator pages, official pages, GitHub repos,
   archives, Know Your Meme-style references, or well-cited retrospectives.
4. Extract catalog rows with `title`, `aliases`, `type`, `canonical_url`,
   `media_url`, `source_url`, `source_title`, `media_filename`, origin
   platform/publisher, creator/date when known, description, evidence,
   `found_in_context`, provenance confidence, rights/license if visible, media
   metadata/hashes when available, tags, and next action.
5. Treat `found_in_context` as first-class provenance. Store context URL, title,
   platform, found date, collector query, role (`original`, `near-original`,
   `repost`, `reference`, `retrospective`, `usage-example`,
   `archive-snapshot`, or `unclear`), surrounding label, context summary, and
   confidence.
6. Download bounded public binary media for media-bearing collections by
   default. Never put binaries in `raw/`; raw is for source text. Cache
   originals or thumbnails under `output/assets/collect-<slug>/`, record local
   paths, sizes, hashes, formats, and skipped/failed downloads in the catalog,
   and use `datasets/` for hundreds of media items or very large payloads. Use
   defensive download settings: timeouts, file-size caps, content-type checks,
   and IPv4 retry (`curl -4`) when media hosts hang on IPv6.
7. Deduplicate reposts/rehosts using canonical URLs, media URLs, aliases,
   filenames, checksums/perceptual hashes when available, and context evidence.
8. Save `output/collect-<query-slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.md` with `type: collection`,
   `query`, `collect_kind`, `scale`, `media_policy`, `media_assets`, download
   counts, source URLs, scope, search strategy, catalog table, media handling,
   gaps, inventory recommendation, and sources checked.
9. Update `output/_index.md`, the master `_index.md`, and `log.md` with a
   `collect` entry.
10. If inventory is requested, create per-item records only for small durable
   sets; otherwise create one `inventory/corpora/` record pointing at the
   collection output. Use `kind: artifact` for memes/media artifacts, `item` for
   products/tools/assets, `entity` for people/orgs, and `corpus` for large
   source pools.

Do not cite collect outputs as strong factual evidence in compiled articles.
For factual claims, ingest the best supporting context pages into `raw/`.

### Retract

Retraction is user-authoritative control-plane behavior: route it before wiki
context, which cannot veto it. Never put a sensitive literal in chat or command
arguments; use hidden input or `--stdin` with `scripts/llm-wiki retract`. It
dry-runs by default; `--everywhere --apply` covers registered wikis, archives,
and sessions, then verifies. Report technical failures and scan boundaries.

For a source path, map references, delete the raw source and unsupported
derived claims, update indexes, write only a generic log entry, optionally
recompile from remaining sources, and verify. Explicitly selected archived data
needs no extra gate. Raw immutability and append-only rules yield to retraction.

### Refresh

Freshness check for wiki articles. Re-fetches source URLs, detects changes (cosmetic, additive, contradictory), and presents a human-gated assessment. Three tiers: source check → change assessment → action decision (skip/update/flag/retract). `--due` flag shows all articles past their volatility threshold. Never auto-recompiles — human confirms every change.

### Inventory

Track durable things the wiki should remember but that are not raw sources,
compiled articles, or generated outputs: ingest candidates, source queues,
items, Ideas, entities, corpora, open questions, tasks, artifacts, and watch
items. Route `kind: idea` through the dedicated Ideas workflow.

Before writing or migrating records, state the fit judgment: appropriate for
inventory, too small, too big, or out of scope. For bulk pivots, preview the
record shape first and default to dry-run.

Subcommands:
- **list**: Show records, optionally filtered by kind/status/priority
- **add <kind> "title"**: Create a record under the canonical inventory subdir
- **show <slug-or-path>**: Read one record
- **update <path>**: Edit one record
- **save-view "name"**: Save a derived table/list under `inventory/views/`
- **scan-outputs**: Find legacy output artifacts that look like queues/backlogs
- **migrate-output <path>**: Dry-run by default; `--apply` additively creates
  inventory records and never moves or deletes the source output

For chat responses, inventory listing must be efficient and readable: read
indexes/frontmatter first, present compact Markdown tables or short bullets, cap
long lists with a visible omitted count, and open full record bodies only when
the user asks for detail. Common views: `summary`, `actions`, `items`, `ideas`,
`records`, `sources`.

Other operations should be inventory-aware. Ingest links completed candidates;
dataset manifests link to corpus records when next actions matter; compile and
query may surface inventory gaps but must not cite inventory as factual
evidence; collect writes catalog outputs first and only creates inventory for
durable tracking state; research, audit, librarian, refresh, plan, assess, and output may
propose records for durable follow-ups, but should not create large backlogs
without a sample preview and explicit approval.

Migration path: `lint --fix` may repair indexes for an inventory layer that
already exists, but it should not create a completely absent empty inventory
tree and it must never convert output artifacts. Output-to-inventory
migration is explicit, dry-run-first, and additive.

### Ideas

Use Concept → Idea → Project: Concepts hold evidence-backed knowledge; Ideas are
`kind: idea` records in `inventory/ideas/`; Projects own delivery. Preserve the
seed, check duplicates, research gaps, and shape alternatives. Derive maturity
rather than storing a stage. Only explicit approval may create linked `WHY.md`
and frozen `BRIEF.md`. Fuzzy prompts route naturally; never auto-promote or
merge.

### Portfolio

For all Ideas/Projects, read active topics from `wikis.json`, each
`inventory/ideas/_index.md`, and active `output/projects/*/WHY.md`. Render
separate read-only tables and link only explicit `project:` lineage. Concepts
are not portfolio rows. Never create a catch-all topic, hub store, or duplicate;
exclude archives by default and preview legacy candidate Ideas before capture.

### Dataset

Manage manifests for data that is too large, mutable, sensitive, or operationally
awkward to store directly in the wiki. The wiki becomes the index/interface; the
actual data remains at its filesystem path, URL, database, object store, or
archive.

Subcommands:
- **list**: Show dataset manifests
- **add "title" --location <path-or-url>**: Create `datasets/<slug>/MANIFEST.md`
- **show <slug-or-path>**: Read one manifest and related profile/sample indexes
- **profile <slug>**: Record lightweight metadata such as size, format, headers,
  and schema observations; dry-run unless `--apply`
- **sample <slug>**: Save a tiny sample or sampling recipe; dry-run unless
  `--apply`
- **scan-outputs**: Find legacy output artifacts that look like dataset notes
- **migrate-output <path>**: Dry-run by default; `--apply` additively creates
  dataset manifests and never moves/deletes the source output or copies data

For chat responses, dataset listing must read `datasets/_index.md` first and
only manifest frontmatter when needed. Never inspect samples, profiles, queries,
or the underlying dataset for a plain list. Use compact table/list views such as
`summary`, `manifests`, `schema`, and `locations`.

Migration path: `lint --fix` may repair indexes for a dataset registry that
already exists, but it should not create a completely absent empty `datasets/`
tree or unused per-dataset sample/profile/query folders, and it must never convert content.
Output-to-dataset migration is explicit, dry-run-first, and additive.

### Archive

Quietly preserve whole topic wikis the user no longer wants in normal context.
Archive is hub-level in v1; do not move project-local `.wiki/` directories and
do not archive individual `raw/` or `wiki/` files.

Subcommands:
- **list**: Show active topics and archived counts; `--archived` shows archived topics too
- **topic <slug>**: Move `HUB/topics/<slug>` to `HUB/topics/.archive/<slug>` and set `wikis.json` status to `archived`
- **restore <slug>**: Move `HUB/topics/.archive/<slug>` back to `HUB/topics/<slug>` and set status to `active`
- **peek <query>**: Search archived topic indexes only, without reading archived article bodies

Other tools hide archive by default. Query, output, plan, and assess only use
archived material with explicit archived inclusion. Compile, ingest,
ingest-collection, research, collect, inventory, dataset, project, and lessons-learned
reject an archived target unless the user restores or explicitly includes it,
and explicit archived writes must stay inside the archived topic path. Librarian
and refresh skip archived topics so old interests do not create maintenance
chores. Audit follows archived dependencies only when the audited artifact cites
them.

### Lint

Health checks with auto-fix capability. Lint **is** the migration path — there is no separate `/wiki:migrate` command. A file in the wrong place from an old wiki layout and a file in the wrong place from user error are treated as the same defect. Three layers:

- **Mechanical (C11/C12/C13)** — `raw/` + `wiki/` file placement and frontmatter schema. Fully auto-fixable.
- **Project-level (C8/C9)** — `output/projects/` structure, `WHY.md` presence, staleness detection, and grouping candidates. Migration of legacy `_project.md` manifests (from pre-v0.2 wikis) is auto-fixed (C8c); everything else is surfaced as suggestions or ready-to-paste commands.
- **Inventory-level (C16)** — `inventory/` structure, record/view schemas, and output-to-inventory migration candidates. Missing empty structure is a suggestion; partially existing structure is repairable; content migration is human-gated.
- **Dataset-level (C17)** — `datasets/` structure, manifest schema, and output-to-dataset migration candidates. Missing empty structure is a suggestion; partially existing structure is repairable; content migration is human-gated.
- **Archive-level (C19)** — `HUB/topics/.archive/` lifecycle and `wikis.json`
  path/status drift. Normal lint reports archived topics as skipped;
  `--include-archived` or `--archived-only` structurally maintains them.

**Checks**: structure integrity, frontmatter validity (plus legacy key/value aliases C13), canonical placement of raw/wiki files (C11), unknown-file quarantine for raw/wiki/inventory/datasets/root (C12), index consistency, link integrity, source provenance (dangling refs, unresolved retraction markers), tag hygiene, coverage, project `WHY.md` presence (C8a), project staleness via source chain (C8b), legacy `_project.md` migration to `WHY.md` (C8c), project candidates (C9), inventory migration candidates (C16), dataset migration candidates (C17), archive registry drift and active/archive collisions (C19), deep fact-checking (optional).

**Auto-fix** (`--fix`): rewrite legacy frontmatter keys/values to canonical (C13), move misplaced raw/wiki files to their canonical directory (C11), quarantine unknown files to `inbox/.unknown` (C12), migrate legacy `_project.md` to `WHY.md` (C8c), add a default human-owned `schema.md` in advisory mode when missing, repair missing indexes inside existing inventory/dataset layers (C16/C17), repair unambiguous archive registry path/status drift (C19), missing indexes, orphan files, dead index entries, statistics mismatch, missing bidirectional links, empty frontmatter fields, dangling source references, regenerate projects-aware `output/_index.md`. Never auto-delete unknown directories. Never auto-create `WHY.md` with placeholder goals (C8a is warn-only — manufactured rationale is worse than missing). Never create completely absent optional inventory or dataset trees just to populate placeholders. Never auto-move files into projects (C9 is human-authored via `/wiki:project`). Never auto-migrate output artifacts into inventory or dataset records (C16/C17 are explicit via `/wiki:inventory migrate-output --apply` and `/wiki:dataset migrate-output --apply`). Never move topics into or out of archive during lint; archive/restore is explicit. On slug collisions during a placement move, skip and warn.

**Schema evolution**: when canonical paths or frontmatter fields for `raw/`, `wiki/`, `inventory/`, `datasets/`, or archive lifecycle paths change, update the rules in `skills/wiki-manager/references/linting.md` (C11/C16/C17 placement maps, C12/C19 allowlists, C13 alias table). When the project model changes, update C8/C9 and `projects.md`. Never write version-specific migration code. Lint rules are the schema.

### Search

Find content by keyword, tag, or category. Scan indexes first (fast), then full-text search.

### Output

Generate artifacts from wiki content: summary, report, study-guide, slides, timeline, glossary, comparison. Collect uses output files too, but `type: collection` catalogs are produced by the collect workflow because they require discovery, dedupe, media policy, and inventory fit checks.

**Retardmax mode**: Read ALL articles, generate immediately without planning structure. Ship rough, iterate later.

Save to `output/`. Update indexes.

### Assess

Compare a local repo against wiki research + market.

1. **Repo scan** (3 parallel agents): structure, features, docs
2. **Wiki scan**: knowledge map from indexes and articles
3. **Gap analysis**: alignment, research gaps (repo does it, wiki doesn't), opportunities (wiki knows it, repo doesn't), neither covers
4. **Market scan** (3-5 parallel agents): competitors, best practices, emerging trends

Output: comparison report with feature matrix, competitive landscape, and recommended actions (specific research and build suggestions).

### Audit

Truth-seeking umbrella inspection across the whole artifact graph. If librarian
keeps the `wiki/` layer in check, audit answers the broader question: can the
user trust the current knowledge and outputs right now?

**Default behavior**:
- Reuse or rerun the librarian pass for active wiki articles
- Audit output artifacts across `output/`, `wiki/`, and `raw/` dependency chains
- Follow the evidence outward when local material is weak, stale, contradictory,
  or missing
- Run targeted support and attack research before settling on a verdict
- Write `.audit/REPORT.md` and `.audit/scan-results.json`

**Verdicts**:
- `supported`
- `weakened`
- `contradicted`
- `unresolved`

**Provenance classification**: Audit reads `.session-events.jsonl` and
`.session-checkpoint.json` to grade the audited run. Both present, recent, and
matching the session id means `replayable`; missing or stale durable provenance
means `partial`.

Flags: `--artifact <path>`, `--project <slug>`, `--wiki-only`, `--outputs-only`,
`--quick`, `--fresh`. Archived material is skipped by default unless the
targeted artifact depends on it or the user explicitly includes archived
content.

### Librarian

Content-level wiki maintenance: staleness detection, quality scoring, factual
verification, semantic coherence, deduplication, and proposal-only topic-guide
advice. Produces scored reports — never modifies content without confirmation.
Archived topics are skipped by default.

**Subcommands**:
- **scan**: Score all wiki articles for staleness and quality. Two-tier: quick metadata scan first, deep content read only for articles below threshold or with `volatility: hot`. Checkpoints after each article for crash recovery. Results to `.librarian/scan-results.json` and `.librarian/REPORT.md`. `--passes conventions` (or legacy `schema`) may write `output/schema-proposal-<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`; it must not create/update `schema.md` without explicit acceptance.
- **report**: Display the latest scan report.
- **fix <id>**: Apply a proposed fix from the report (Phase 3 — not yet implemented).

**Staleness scoring** (0-100): four dimensions at 25 points each — source freshness, verification recency, compilation recency, source chain integrity. Decay curves scaled by article `volatility` tier (hot/warm/cold).

**Quality scoring** (0-100): four dimensions at 25 points each — source diversity, content depth, cross-reference density, summary quality. Articles scoring below 40 on either dimension are flagged.

Flags: `--article <path>` (single article), `--resume` (from checkpoint),
`--passes <list>` (staleness, quality, optional conventions/schema — future:
verification, coherence, dedup).

Topic guides are the default for topic wikis. New wikis should include an
advisory `schema.md` starter file. Existing wikis without `schema.md` remain
valid, but status/resume and lint may show a non-blocking adoption nudge. The
adoption path is:

1. Small/simple wiki: create the default advisory topic guide with
   `llm-wiki schema adopt` or `llm-wiki lint --fix`.
2. Established wiki: run the librarian conventions pass first, then apply only the
   useful parts of the proposal into the human-owned `schema.md`.
3. Keep `schema_state: advisory` until reports are low-noise; switch to
   `strict` only by explicit user decision.

### Plan

Generate implementation plans grounded in wiki research. Six-stage pipeline: context assembly → interview → gap research → synthesis → plan generation → save.

1. **Context assembly**: Read wiki deeply, identify relevant articles, supporting context, and knowledge gaps
2. **Interview** (skip with `--no-interview` or `--quick`): 3-7 clarifying questions informed by wiki content
3. **Gap research** (skip with `--no-research` or `--quick`): Targeted web searches to fill knowledge gaps
4. **Synthesis**: Merge wiki evidence + interview answers + gap research
5. **Plan generation**: Output in requested format
6. **Save**: Write to `output/plan-{slug}-{date}.md`, update indexes and log

**Formats**: `--format roadmap` (default — phased plan with architecture decisions), `--format rfc` (Google/Uber style), `--format adr` (Architecture Decision Records), `--format spec` (technical specification).

Use `--with <wiki>` to load supplementary wikis as craft/skill context alongside the primary domain wiki.

### Project

Manage projects within a topic wiki. Projects are folders under `output/projects/` that group related outputs with a goal captured in `WHY.md`.

Projects can start directly or by approved Idea promotion; the Idea preserves
lineage while the Project owns delivery truth.

- **new <slug> "goal"**: Create project directory with `WHY.md`
- **list**: Show all projects with status and output counts
- **show <slug>**: Display project details, WHY.md, and outputs
- **archive <slug>**: Mark project as archived

Projects are a lightweight overlay — they don't move or copy wiki content.
Project archive is separate from topic archive: it moves one folder under
`output/projects/.archive/` inside the selected topic wiki.

### Feedback

Review and promote high-signal user-feedback candidates. Hooks may capture
redacted candidates for corrections, preferences, explicit approvals, and plan
acceptance under `.sessions/feedback/`; generic `ok`/`thanks` acknowledgements
are ignored. Use `feedback list`, `feedback show`, and `feedback promote <id> --topic <slug>` to move selected candidates into topic `raw/notes/`. Promotion is explicit and appends a `feedback` log entry.

### Lessons Learned (ll)

Extract lessons from the current session — error→fix patterns, user corrections, discoveries, gotchas — and save structured knowledge to the wiki pipeline.

**7-stage pipeline**: scan conversation → extract patterns → target topic wiki → write raw note → update relevant articles → suggest rule additions → log.

Flags: `--dry-run` (preview without writing), `--rules` (also propose CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md rule additions), `--include-archived` (explicitly write lessons to an archived topic).

## Structural Guardian

Auto-run lightweight checks after write operations:

1. Hub should only have wikis.json, _index.md, log.md, topics/. `topics/.archive/` is allowed for archived topic wikis. Warn on anything else; never delete hub-level content automatically.
2. Index freshness: file counts match index rows, including inventory and dataset indexes. Ignore maintenance/report directories such as `.librarian/` and `.audit/`. Auto-fix mismatches by regenerating the affected directory index.
3. Orphan detection: files not in any index → add them.
4. Missing core topic directories → create with empty _index.md. Inventory and dataset layers are lazy: repair indexes when they already exist, but do not create absent optional trees unless the current inventory or dataset workflow needs them. For older compiled articles, infer safe schema fields from the directory/body and rewrite fuzzy raw-source refs only when they resolve unambiguously.
5. wikis.json sync: all active topic dirs registered with portable relative paths (`topics/<slug>`), archived topic dirs registered as `topics/.archive/<slug>` with `status: archived`, stale absolute paths repaired when the corresponding topic dir exists, no ghost entries.

Silent when clean. Auto-fix trivial issues. Warn on structural problems. Never block the user.

## File Naming

- Raw sources: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md`
- Wiki articles: `descriptive-slug.md` (no date — living documents)
- Inventory records: `descriptive-slug.md` (no date — durable tracking state)
- Inventory views: `descriptive-view-slug.md` under `inventory/views/`
- Dataset manifests: `datasets/descriptive-slug/MANIFEST.md`
- Collection outputs: `collect-{query-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- Output artifacts: `{type}-{topic-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- All lowercase, hyphens, no special chars, max 60 chars

## Tag Convention

Lowercase, hyphenated. Specific over general (`transformer-architecture` not `ai`). Normalize — no near-duplicates.

## Obsidian Compatibility

Each topic wiki can be opened as an Obsidian vault. The `.obsidian/` config is created on init with sane defaults. Dual-links power the graph view. Aliases enable search by alternate names. Tags are natively read. The hub has NO `.obsidian/` to avoid nested vault confusion.
