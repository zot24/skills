# Gates

> Async wait conditions that park a workflow step until the world catches up — a human decision, a timer, or a GitHub run or PR.

Some workflow steps can't proceed on code alone: a release needs CI to go
green, a deploy needs a human sign-off, a cleanup should wait 24 hours. A
**gate** is an issue that represents that wait. It blocks a step the same way
any blocker does — the step leaves the ready frontier until the gate closes —
so agents never need to poll or spin.

## How a gate works

A gate is a bead like any other: created open, it blocks its waiters through
a normal dependency edge, and the step becomes ready the moment the gate
closes. Gates close in one of two ways:

* **Manually** — `bd gate resolve <gate-id>` (human gates always close this
  way).
* **Via `bd gate check`** — evaluates open timer, GitHub, and bead gates
  against the real world and closes the ones whose condition is met.

```bash theme={null}
bd gate list                 # open gates
bd gate list --all           # include closed
bd gate show <gate-id>       # details and waiters
bd gate check                # evaluate open gates, close satisfied ones
bd gate check --dry-run      # report without closing
bd gate resolve <gate-id>    # close a gate manually
```

## Gate types

| Type | Waits for | Closed by |
| - | - | - |
| `human` | a person's decision | `bd gate resolve` only |
| `timer` | a duration after gate creation | `bd gate check` once the timeout elapses |
| `gh:run` | a GitHub Actions workflow to complete successfully | `bd gate check` (uses `gh run view`) |
| `gh:pr` | a pull request to merge | `bd gate check` (uses `gh pr view`) |
| `bead` | a bead to close — a plain ID names a bead in this rig, the cross-rig form is `<rig>:<bead-id>` | `bd gate check` for plain local IDs; cross-rig values cannot be checked — resolve those manually |

Timeouts use Go duration syntax: `30m`, `1h`, `24h` (there is no `d` unit —
write `24h`, not `1d`).

GitHub gates use the current Git repository by default. To evaluate a PR or
workflow run in another repository, set the gate's string `metadata.repo` value
to `OWNER/REPO` or `HOST/OWNER/REPO`. An ad-hoc `gh:run`/`gh:pr` gate created
with `bd gate create` inherits a valid `metadata.repo` value from the issue it
blocks; `human`/`timer`/`bead` gates do not, since `metadata.repo` is
unrelated, ordinary metadata for those types. `bd gate check` rejects
malformed repository values instead of falling back to the current
repository.

### Known limitations: multi-rig and proxied-server topologies

Bead gates and prefix routing (`routes.jsonl`) do not work in every
topology. Three limitations to expect, all tracked in
[#5861](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/issues/5861):

* **Cross-rig bead gates never resolve on their own.** A `<rig>:<bead-id>`
  await value reports `cannot be checked (multi-rig routing removed)` and
  stays pending regardless of the awaited bead's status. Close it with
  `bd gate resolve`.
* **`bd close` cannot verify a bead gate in the experimental proxied-server
  mode.** Proxied-server commands never open a local store, so closing the
  gate refuses with `no local store available` even when the awaited bead is
  closed. Run `bd gate check`, which evaluates bead gates in proxied-server
  mode and closes the satisfied ones, or `bd close --force`.
* **Prefix routing cannot open a proxied-server target rig.** A routed
  lookup into a rig that is itself in proxied-server mode fails with
  `proxy server store needs to be uow provider`, so an all-proxied
  shared-server topology cannot resolve routed targets at all.

## Gates in formulas

A formula step declares a gate with a `[steps.gate]` block. When the formula
is instantiated, bd creates the gate issue and wires it as a blocker of that
step. The schema has five fields: `type`, `id`, `await_id`, `timeout`, and
`repo`.

This is the release gate from beads' own release formula — the step that
waits for the GitHub release workflow:

```toml theme={null}
[[steps]]
id = "wait-for-ci"
title = "Wait for release workflow"

[steps.gate]
type = "gh:run"
id = "release.yml"       # which workflow to watch
timeout = "30m"          # escalate if it takes longer
```

For a `gh:run` or `gh:pr` gate that watches another repository, set `repo`
the same way a `metadata.repo` value works for an ad-hoc gate — `OWNER/REPO`
or `HOST/OWNER/REPO`. Malformed values are rejected when the gate is checked:

```toml theme={null}
[[steps]]
id = "wait-for-downstream"
title = "Wait for downstream release"

[steps.gate]
type = "gh:run"
id = "release.yml"
repo = "org/downstream-repo"   # check gh:run against this repo, not the current one
```

`repo` accepts a `{{var}}` placeholder (e.g. `repo = "{{gate_repo}}"`); for a
formula persisted with `bd cook --persist`, the placeholder is substituted
when the proto is later poured with `bd mol pour --var gate_repo=...`, the
same as every other var-bearing step field (`title`, `description`, `design`,
`acceptance_criteria`, `notes`, `assignee`, `labels`, `await_id`, and the
string values inside `metadata`).

`bd gate discover` (auto-discovery of a `gh:run` gate's run ID) requires a
workflow name hint (`await_id`/`id`, not left blank) for a gate targeting
another repository — without one, the local commit/branch heuristics that
narrow a same-repo match don't apply across repos, so nothing but the
workflow name can identify the right run. A cross-repo gate discovery also
ignores the local checkout's branch unless `--branch` is passed explicitly;
an auto-detected local branch has no relationship to the target repo's
branches.

A human sign-off gate:

```toml theme={null}
[[steps]]
id = "approve-deploy"
title = "Human approves the deploy"

[steps.gate]
type = "human"
```

And a cooling-off timer:

```toml theme={null}
[[steps]]
id = "wait-24h"
title = "Let the release bake"

[steps.gate]
type = "timer"
timeout = "24h"
```

Verify what the parser actually understood before pouring — unknown keys in
TOML are dropped silently:

```bash theme={null}
bd formula show <formula> --json   # inspect the parsed gate blocks
```

## Creating gates outside formulas

`bd gate create` attaches a gate to existing work:

```bash theme={null}
# Block bd-abc until a PR merges
bd gate create --type=gh:pr --blocks bd-abc --await-id=42

# Block bd-abc until a human resolves the gate
bd gate create --type=human --blocks bd-abc --reason "Design sign-off"

# Add another waiter to an existing gate
bd gate add-waiter <gate-id> <issue-id>
```

## Fan-in: waiting on other steps

Waiting on *other steps* is not a gate — it's a dependency. Use `needs` to
fan in on named steps, and `waits_for` when a step must wait for
dynamically-created children:

```toml theme={null}
[[steps]]
id = "merge-results"
title = "Merge results"
needs = ["test-a", "test-b"]     # fan-in on named steps

[[steps]]
id = "fan-out"
title = "Spawn a worker per shard"

[[steps]]
id = "summarize"
title = "Summarize all spawned work"
needs = ["fan-out"]              # the spawner whose children to wait for
waits_for = "all-children"       # or "any-children", or "children-of(fan-out)"
```

`all-children` and `any-children` wait for the children of `needs[0]`, so a step
using them must declare `needs`; `children-of(step-id)` names the spawner itself
and does not. A bare gate with neither is rejected when the formula is cooked,
because it would wait for no one.

## Working with gated molecules

```bash theme={null}
bd ready --gated        # molecules where a gate just closed (ready to resume)
bd blocked              # what's waiting, and on which gates
```

Automation patterns: run `bd gate check` on a schedule (cron, CI, or an
orchestrator loop) so timer and GitHub gates close without a human in the
loop; keep `human` gates for the decisions that should never auto-close.
