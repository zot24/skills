# Sync Concepts

> Why Dolt is the source of truth for sync and how the JSONL export differs from bd dolt push and pull

Beads issue data lives in Dolt. The local Dolt database is the source of truth
for `bd list`, `bd show`, `bd ready`, and every write command.

## The Wire Format

Cross-machine sync uses Dolt remotes:

```bash theme={null}
bd dolt push
bd dolt pull
```

For normal git-hosted projects, the Dolt remote can be the same `origin` URL
used for source code. Dolt stores issue history under `refs/dolt/data`, separate
from source branches such as `refs/heads/main`.

On new projects, `bd init` auto-detects `git remote get-url origin` and
configures a Dolt remote named `origin`. The first `bd dolt push` publishes
`refs/dolt/data`. Fresh clones should run `bd bootstrap` to clone that Dolt
history. When bootstrap finds `refs/dolt/data` on git origin, it also wires
that origin as the Dolt remote for future `bd dolt push` and `bd dolt pull`.

## What JSONL Is For

`.beads/issues.jsonl` is an export. It exists for viewers, interchange,
migration, and backup. It is not the canonical cross-machine sync channel.

Do not use routine `bd import .beads/issues.jsonl` as a replacement for
`bd dolt pull`. JSONL import is upsert-only; it cannot infer that records absent
from an export were deleted, pruned, or simply never exported.

## Hooks

The pre-commit hook refreshes `.beads/issues.jsonl` when `export.auto=true`.
That keeps the export current for tools, but it does not push Dolt history.

The post-merge and post-checkout hooks skip JSONL import when `sync.remote` is
configured. For old projects with no Dolt remote, they may import JSONL as a
compatibility fallback and print a warning that this is not durable sync.

## Repair

For projects initialized before automatic git-origin remote wiring, pick the
machine with the authoritative local Dolt database first. Then run:

```bash theme={null}
bd dolt remote list
bd export -o .beads/issues.pre-remote.jsonl   # optional issue audit export
bd dolt remote add origin <git-origin-url>
bd dolt push
```

Use the Dolt-compatible git URL form when needed. For example,
`git+ssh://git@github.com/org/repo.git` or
`git+https://github.com/org/repo.git`. `bd dolt remote add origin ...`
persists `sync.remote` into `.beads/config.yaml`; commit and push that config
change so fresh clones can run `bd bootstrap`.

Other machines should then run:

```bash theme={null}
bd dolt pull
# or, if the local database is stale or missing:
bd bootstrap
```
