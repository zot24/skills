# Installation

> Install the bd CLI, Claude Code plugin, and MCP server on macOS, Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD via Homebrew, npm, or go install

Complete installation guide for all platforms.

## Components Overview

Beads has several components - here's what they are and when you need them:

| Component                  | What It Is                       | When You Need It                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bd CLI**                 | Core command-line tool           | Always - this is the foundation                                 |
| **Claude Code Plugin**     | Slash commands + enhanced UX     | Optional - if you want `/beads:ready`, `/beads:create` commands |
| **MCP Server (beads-mcp)** | Model Context Protocol interface | Only for MCP-only environments (Claude Desktop, Amp)            |

**How they relate:**

* The **bd CLI** is the core - install it first via Homebrew, npm, or script
* The **Plugin** enhances Claude Code with slash commands but *requires* the CLI installed
* The **MCP server** is an *alternative* to the CLI for environments without shell access

**Important:** Beads is installed system-wide, not cloned into your project. The `.beads/` directory in your project only contains the issue database.

**Typical setups:**

| Environment                   | What to Install                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf | bd CLI (+ optional Plugin for Claude Code) |
| GitHub Copilot (VS Code)      | bd CLI + MCP server                        |
| Claude Desktop (no shell)     | MCP server only                            |
| Terminal / scripts            | bd CLI only                                |
| CI/CD pipelines               | bd CLI only                                |

**Are they mutually exclusive?** No - you can have CLI + Plugin + MCP all installed. They don't conflict. But most users only need the CLI.

## Quick Install (Recommended)

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash theme={null}
brew install beads
```

Homebrew core's `beads` formula is the supported Homebrew package. If you
previously installed the old tap formula as `bd`, see
[Migrating from the old Homebrew tap](/getting-started/upgrading#homebrew) to
switch to the core formula.

**Why Homebrew?**

* Simple one-command install
* Automatic updates via `brew upgrade`
* No need to install Go
* Handles PATH setup automatically

### Mise-en-place (macOS/Linux/Windows)

You can install beads using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) from the latest GitHub release:

```bash theme={null}
mise install github:gastownhall/beads
mise use -g github:gastownhall/beads
```

The `-g` enables beads globally. To enable project-specific versions, omit it.

**Why Mise?**

* Same as Homebrew: simple, updates via `mise up`, works without Go, handles PATH
* Supports all platforms
* Always the latest release
* May optionally use a different release version for specific projects

Mise's Go backend follows the same caveats as `go install`; prefer the release backend above.

### Quick Install Script (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD)

```bash theme={null}
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:

* Detect your platform (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD, amd64/arm64)
* Verify downloaded release archives against release `checksums.txt`
* Fall back to the supported `go install` modes if Go is available
* Fall back to building from source if needed
* Guide you through PATH setup if necessary

On macOS, the script preserves the downloaded binary signature by default. If you explicitly want ad-hoc local re-signing, opt in:

```bash theme={null}
BEADS_INSTALL_RESIGN_MACOS=1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Comparison of Installation Methods

| Method                 | Best For                            | Updates                            | Prerequisites        | Notes                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Homebrew**           | macOS/Linux users                   | `brew upgrade beads`               | Homebrew             | Recommended. Handles everything automatically |
| **Mise**               | All platforms                       | `mise up`                          | mise                 | Installs the latest GitHub release            |
| **npm**                | JS/Node.js projects                 | `npm update -g @beads/bd`          | Node.js              | Convenient if npm is your ecosystem           |
| **bun**                | JS/Bun.js projects                  | `bun install -g --trust @beads/bd` | Bun.js               | Convenient if bun is your ecosystem           |
| **Install script**     | Quick setup, CI/CD                  | Re-run script                      | curl, bash           | Good for automation and one-liners            |
| **go install (nocgo)** | Go developers, simplest install     | Re-run command                     | Go 1.24+             | **Server-mode only** (no embedded Dolt)       |
| **go install (cgo)**   | Go developers wanting embedded mode | Re-run command                     | Go 1.24+, C compiler | Full embedded-Dolt support                    |
| **From source**        | Contributors only                   | `git pull && go build`             | Go, git              | Full control, can modify code                 |
| **AUR (Arch)**         | Arch Linux users                    | `yay -Syu`                         | yay/paru             | Community-maintained                          |

**TL;DR:** Use Homebrew if available. Use npm if you're in a Node.js environment. Use the script for quick one-off installs or CI.

## Go Install and Build Dependencies

Use Homebrew, npm, or the install script if you do not specifically need `go install`.

`go install` has two supported modes that give different capabilities:

* **Server-mode only (nocgo, simplest):** `CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`. Works on any machine with a Go toolchain, no C compiler needed. Produces a server-mode-only binary — you must run an external `dolt sql-server` and use `bd init --server`. See [Dolt](/architecture/dolt) for server-mode setup.
* **Embedded-capable (cgo):** `CGO_ENABLED=1 GOFLAGS=-tags=gms_pure_go go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`. Requires a C compiler (gcc/clang on Unix, MinGW on Windows). Produces a binary with the default embedded-Dolt backend — `bd init` Just Works.

ICU headers are not required. The embedded-capable command uses `gms_pure_go` so go-mysql-server uses Go's stdlib regexp instead of ICU.

Use the `github.com/steveyegge/beads` path for `go install`. The repository now lives under `gastownhall/beads`, but released Go modules still declare `github.com/steveyegge/beads` for compatibility.

If you don't have a preference, `brew install beads` or the install script give you the embedded-capable build with no fuss.

### Build Dependencies (Contributors Only)


  These dependencies are only needed if you build from source. If you installed via Homebrew, npm, or the install script, skip this section entirely.


Building from source requires a C compiler (for CGO / embedded Dolt). ICU is
not required — all builds use the `gms_pure_go` tag which selects Go's
stdlib `regexp` instead of ICU regex. See
[ICU-POLICY.md](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/engdocs/ICU-POLICY.md)
for details.

macOS (Homebrew):

```bash theme={null}
brew install zstd
```

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash theme={null}
sudo apt-get install -y libzstd-dev
```

Linux (Fedora/RHEL):

```bash theme={null}
sudo dnf install -y libzstd-devel
```

For maintainers only: if you intentionally need to run
[scripts/test-icu-path.sh](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/scripts/test-icu-path.sh)
(which exercises the leftover ICU code path), install ICU headers:
`brew install icu4c` (macOS) or `sudo apt-get install -y libicu-dev` (Linux).
This is not needed for normal development.

## Platform-Specific Installation

### macOS

**Via Homebrew** (recommended):

```bash theme={null}
brew install beads
```

**Via go install** (server-mode only):

```bash theme={null}
CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

**Via go install** (embedded-capable, needs Xcode CLI tools):

```bash theme={null}
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOFLAGS=-tags=gms_pure_go go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

**From source**:

```bash theme={null}
git clone https://github.com/gastownhall/beads
cd beads
make build
sudo mv bd /usr/local/bin/
```

### Linux

**Via Homebrew** (works on Linux too):

```bash theme={null}
brew install beads
```

**Arch Linux** (AUR):

```bash theme={null}
# Install from AUR
yay -S beads-git
# or
paru -S beads-git
```

Thanks to [@v4rgas](https://github.com/v4rgas) for maintaining the AUR package!

**Via go install** (server-mode only):

```bash theme={null}
CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

**Via go install** (embedded-capable, needs gcc):

```bash theme={null}
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOFLAGS=-tags=gms_pure_go go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

### FreeBSD

**Via quick install script**:

```bash theme={null}
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Via go install** (server-mode only):

```bash theme={null}
CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

### Windows 11

Beads ships with native Windows support—no MSYS or MinGW required.

**Prerequisites:**

* [Go 1.24+](https://go.dev/dl/) installed (add `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` to your `PATH`)
* Git for Windows

**Via PowerShell script**:

```pwsh theme={null}
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The script installs a prebuilt Windows release if available and verifies the downloaded ZIP checksum against release `checksums.txt`. Go is only required for `go install` or building from source.

**Via go install** (server-mode only):

```pwsh theme={null}
$env:CGO_ENABLED="0"; go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

This produces a server-mode-only binary with no C compiler requirement — the fastest path to a working `bd` on Windows.

**Via go install** (embedded-capable, needs a Windows CGO toolchain):

```pwsh theme={null}
$env:CGO_ENABLED="1"; $env:GOFLAGS="-tags=gms_pure_go"; go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

Requires a GCC-compatible Windows CGO compiler on your PATH, such as
MinGW-w64/MSYS2 `gcc` or MSYS2 LLVM `clang` targeting `windows-gnu`
(`clang64`/`clangarm64`). ICU is **not** required — `gms_pure_go` selects
Go's stdlib `regexp`. Visual Studio `cl.exe` by itself is not enough because
Go passes GCC-style CGO flags; use a MinGW/MSYS2 toolchain, set `CC`, or set
`WINDOWS_CGO_BINS` when building from source.

**From source**:

```pwsh theme={null}
git clone https://github.com/gastownhall/beads
cd beads
make build
Move-Item bd.exe $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\
```

**Windows notes:**

* The Dolt server listens on a loopback TCP endpoint
* Allow `bd.exe` loopback traffic through any host firewall
* Installed from npm, `bd` is a `bd.cmd` shim — Node's `execFile`/`spawn`
  need `shell: true` to run it ([details](/reference/troubleshooting#platform-specific-issues))

## IDE and Editor Integrations

### CLI + Hooks (Recommended)

The recommended approach for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other editors with shell access:

```bash theme={null}
# 1. Install bd CLI (see Quick Install above)
brew install beads

# 2. Initialize in your project
cd your-project
bd init --quiet

# 3. Setup editor integration (choose one)
bd setup claude   # Claude Code - installs SessionStart hooks
bd setup copilot  # GitHub Copilot CLI - creates .copilot-plugin/plugin.json + .github/copilot-instructions.md
bd setup cursor   # Cursor IDE - creates .cursor/rules/beads.mdc
bd setup aider    # Aider - creates .aider.conf.yml
bd setup codex    # Codex CLI - installs Beads skill, AGENTS.md guidance, and native hooks
bd setup factory  # Factory.ai Droid - creates/updates AGENTS.md
bd setup mux      # Mux - creates/updates AGENTS.md
```

**How it works:**

* `bd init` creates or updates `AGENTS.md` and installs project Claude/Codex integrations by default unless you use `--skip-agents` or `--stealth`
* Editor hooks/rules inject `bd prime` automatically on session start
* Codex 0.129.0+ uses native `/hooks`: SessionStart injects `bd prime`, compact hooks mark context stale, and the next prompt after compaction refreshes Beads context once
* `bd prime` provides \~1-2k tokens of workflow context
* You use `bd` CLI commands directly
* Git hooks (installed by `bd init`) refresh exports and legacy fallbacks; `bd dolt push/pull` syncs the database
* `bd onboard` prints the small manual snippet for unsupported agents or custom instruction files

**Why this is recommended:**

* **Context efficient** - \~1-2k tokens vs 10-50k for MCP tool schemas
* **Lower latency** - Direct CLI calls, no MCP protocol overhead
* **Universal** - Works with any editor that has shell access

**Verify installation:** every recipe supports a check flag, e.g. `bd setup claude --check` or `bd setup copilot --check`.

### Claude Code Plugin (Optional)

For enhanced UX with slash commands:

```bash theme={null}
# In Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add gastownhall/beads
/plugin install beads
# Restart Claude Code
```

The plugin adds:

* Slash commands: `/beads:ready`, `/beads:create`, `/beads:show`, `/beads:update`, `/beads:close`, etc.
* Task agent for autonomous execution

See [Claude Code Plugin](/integrations/claude-code-plugin) for complete plugin documentation.

### GitHub Copilot

For **VS Code with GitHub Copilot**, install the MCP server (`uv tool install beads-mcp`) and create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project — or add it to the VS Code user-level MCP config to enable it for all projects. See [GitHub Copilot](/integrations/github-copilot) for the complete setup guide, including the user-level config paths per platform.

For the **GitHub Copilot CLI** terminal integration:

```bash theme={null}
bd setup copilot         # Install project Copilot plugin + repository instructions
bd setup copilot --check # Verify the project integration files exist
```

This setup is currently project-scoped only. It writes `.copilot-plugin/plugin.json` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; there is no separate `--global` or `--project` mode for Copilot today, and it does not manage `~/.copilot/...` paths. See [Copilot CLI](/integrations/copilot-cli) for the full guide.

### MCP Server (Alternative)

Use MCP only when CLI is unavailable (Claude Desktop, Sourcegraph Amp without shell):

```bash theme={null}
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install beads-mcp

# Or using pip
pip install beads-mcp
```

**Configuration for Claude Desktop** (macOS):

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beads": {
      "command": "beads-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For Sourcegraph Amp configuration and detailed MCP server documentation, see [MCP Server](/integrations/mcp-server).

## Verifying Installation

After installing, verify bd is working:

```bash theme={null}
bd version
bd help
```

## Troubleshooting

For additional troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting).

### `bd: command not found`

bd is not in your PATH:

```bash theme={null}
# Check if installed
go list -f {{.Target}} github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd

# Add Go bin to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"

# Or reinstall with the recommended installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### `zsh: killed bd` or crashes on macOS

This is typically caused by CGO/SQLite compatibility issues:

```bash theme={null}
# Install an embedded-capable build
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOFLAGS=-tags=gms_pure_go go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

If you installed via Homebrew, this shouldn't be necessary as the formula already enables CGO. If you're still seeing crashes with the Homebrew version, please [file an issue](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/issues).

### MCP server fails to start (standalone beads-mcp)

The Claude Code plugin itself does not bundle an MCP server. If you configured the standalone `beads-mcp` server (see [MCP Server](/integrations/mcp-server)) and it fails immediately, `uv` is likely not installed or not in your PATH.

**Symptoms:**

* Plugin slash commands work, but MCP tools are unavailable
* Error logs show `command not found: uv`
* Server fails silently on startup

**Solution:**

```bash theme={null}
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Restart your shell or update PATH
source ~/.local/bin/env

# Verify uv is available
which uv

# Restart Claude Code
```

See [Claude Code Plugin](/integrations/claude-code-plugin) for alternative installation methods.

## Updating bd

Upgrade checklist:

1. With your current `bd`, sync remote-backed databases before installing the
   new binary:
   `bd dolt push`
   `bd dolt pull`
2. Back up before migration:
   `bd export --all -o .beads/backup/pre-migrate-$(date +%Y%m%d).jsonl`
3. Upgrade using the command for your install method below.
4. After upgrading:
   `bd info --whats-new`
   `bd hooks install`
   `bd version`
5. If crossing a schema migration on a remote-backed database, only the
   designated migrator runs:
   `bd migrate`
   `bd dolt push`

Other clones should install the new binary and run `bd bootstrap`, not
independently migrate. For the full procedure, see [Upgrading](/getting-started/upgrading).

### Quick install script (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD)

```bash theme={null}
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### PowerShell installer (Windows)

```pwsh theme={null}
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Homebrew

```bash theme={null}
brew upgrade beads
```

### npm

```bash theme={null}
npm update -g @beads/bd
```

### bun

```bash theme={null}
bun install -g --trust @beads/bd
```

### go install

Use whichever mode you installed with originally:

```bash theme={null}
# Server-mode only
CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest

# Embedded-capable
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOFLAGS=-tags=gms_pure_go go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

### From source

```bash theme={null}
cd beads
git pull
make build
sudo mv bd /usr/local/bin/
```

Prereleases (e.g. release candidates) are published only as GitHub prereleases
and are not pushed to the stable Homebrew/npm/PyPI channels, so `brew upgrade`
and friends will not move you onto them — fetch the prerelease build explicitly.

For post-upgrade steps (hooks, migrations), see [Upgrading](/getting-started/upgrading).

## Uninstalling

To completely remove Beads from a repository, see [Uninstalling](/recovery/uninstalling).

## Next Steps

After installation:

1. **Initialize a project**: `cd your-project && bd init`
2. **Learn the basics**: See [Quick Start](/getting-started/quickstart)
3. **Configure your agent**: See [IDE Setup](/getting-started/ide-setup), or run `bd setup --list`
4. **Explore examples**: Check out the [examples/](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/tree/main/examples) directory
