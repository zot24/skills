# Introduction

> Dependency-aware, Dolt-backed issue tracker built for AI coding agents that survive context loss

**Beads** (`bd`) is a Dolt-powered issue tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.

These docs are for the 1.1.0 release of beads — see the [v1.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

## Why Beads?

Traditional issue trackers (Jira, GitHub Issues) weren't designed for AI agents. Beads was built from the ground up for:

* **AI-native workflows** - Hash-based IDs prevent collisions when multiple agents work concurrently
* **Dolt-backed storage** - Issues stored in a version-controlled SQL database, enabling collaboration via Dolt-native replication
* **Dependency-aware execution** - `bd ready` shows only unblocked work
* **Formula system** - Declarative templates for repeatable workflows
* **Multi-agent coordination** - Routing, gates, and molecules for complex workflows

## Quick Start

```bash theme={null}
# Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install beads

# Or quick install (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
bd init --quiet

# Create your first issue
bd create "Set up database" -p 1 -t task

# See ready work
bd ready
```

## Core Concepts

The whole model on one page: [How Beads Works](/core-concepts/index).

| Concept                                         | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Beads (issues)**](/core-concepts/issues)     | Work items with priorities, types, labels, and dependencies |
| [**Dependencies**](/core-concepts/dependencies) | `blocks`, `parent-child`, `discovered-from`, `related`      |
| [**Sync**](/core-concepts/sync-concepts)        | Dolt push/pull over your git remote — no server to run      |
| [**Formulas**](/workflows/formulas)             | Declarative workflow templates (TOML or JSON)               |
| [**Molecules**](/workflows/molecules)           | Work graphs instantiated from formulas                      |
| [**Gates**](/workflows/gates)                   | Async coordination primitives (human, timer, GitHub)        |

## For AI Agents

Beads is optimized for AI coding agents:

```bash theme={null}
# Always use --json for programmatic access
bd list --json
bd show bd-42 --json

# Track discovered work during implementation
bd create "Found bug in auth" --description="Details..." \
  --deps discovered-from:bd-100 --json

# Push changes at end of session
bd dolt push
```

See the [Claude Code integration](/integrations/claude-code) for detailed agent instructions.

## Architecture

```
Dolt DB (.beads/embeddeddolt/ in embedded mode,
         .beads/dolt/ in server mode; gitignored)
    ↕ dolt commit
Local Dolt history
    ↕ dolt push/pull
Remote Dolt repository (shared across machines)
```

The magic is automatic synchronization via Dolt's version-controlled database with built-in replication.
