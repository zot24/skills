# Extend Claude with skills

> Create, manage, and share skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code. Includes custom commands and bundled skills.

Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.

Create a skill when you keep pasting the same instructions, checklist, or multi-step procedure into chat, or when a section of CLAUDE.md has grown into a procedure rather than a fact. Unlike CLAUDE.md content, a skill's body loads only when it's used, so long reference material costs almost nothing until you need it.


  For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, and bundled skills like `/debug` and `/code-review`, see the [commands reference](/docs/en/commands).

  **Custom commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create `/deploy` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.


Claude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like [invocation control](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), [subagent execution](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), and [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context). See [Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code](#using-skill-frontmatter-outside-claude-code) for which frontmatter fields are part of the standard and which are Claude Code extensions.

## Bundled skills

Claude Code includes a set of bundled skills, such as `/doctor`, `/code-review`, `/batch`, `/debug`, `/loop`, and `/claude-api`. Bundled skills are prompt-based: they give Claude detailed instructions and let it orchestrate the work using its tools. Most built-in commands instead execute fixed logic directly.

You invoke a bundled skill the same way as any other skill, by typing `/` followed by the skill name. Claude invokes some bundled skills automatically when relevant; others, including `/verify`, run only when you invoke them, which keeps you in control of when these longer-running checks spend time and tokens.

Bundled skills are available in every session. To turn them off, use the [`disableBundledSkills`](/docs/en/settings#available-settings) setting, which disables every bundled skill except `/doctor`.


  The [`/doctor`](/docs/en/commands#all-commands) setup checkup stays typable when `disableBundledSkills` is on, in Claude Code v2.1.205 and later. To hide it, set the `DISABLE_DOCTOR_COMMAND` environment variable or a [`skillOverrides`](#override-skill-visibility-from-settings) entry of `"doctor": "off"`. Before v2.1.205, `/doctor` was a built-in command rather than a bundled skill.


Bundled skills are listed alongside built-in commands in the [commands reference](/docs/en/commands), marked **Skill** in the Purpose column.

### Run and verify your app

Three bundled skills work together to launch your app and confirm changes against the running app instead of just tests:

| Skill                  | Purpose                                                                                                           |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/run`                 | Launch and drive your app to see a change working                                                                 |
| `/verify`              | Build and run your app to confirm a code change does what it should, without falling back to tests or type checks |
| `/run-skill-generator` | Teach `/run` and `/verify` how to build and launch your project                                                   |

All three skills require Claude Code v2.1.145 or later. Check your version with `claude --version` or the `/status` command.

`/run` and `/verify` work without setup. They infer the launch from your project type (CLI, server, TUI, browser-driven) and from what's in your README, `package.json`, or `Makefile`. That inference gets unreliable for projects that need anything beyond a standard launch: a database, an env file, a graphical session, a multi-step build.

`/run-skill-generator` records the recipe instead. It gets your app running from a clean environment, captures what worked (the install commands, the env vars, the launch script), and commits it as a per-project skill at `.claude/skills/run-<name>/`. After that, `/run`, `/verify`, and any other agent in the repo follow the recorded recipe instead of rediscovering it. Run `/run-skill-generator` once per project, and again if the build or launch process changes.

`/verify` can also record its own recipe. When it has to build and drive your app without a recorded recipe, it writes what worked to `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md` at the repo root, or in the touched package directory in a monorepo, so later runs and other agents follow the same steps. At the repo root, the recorded skill replaces the bundled `/verify`. This requires Claude Code v2.1.200 or later.

Claude edits the recorded file only when it steered a run wrong, such as a command that failed or a missing step, so you can commit the file without per-session diffs. Before v2.1.205, the bundled skill told Claude to fold in anything a run learned, which caused frequent merge conflicts.

## Getting started

### Create your first skill

This example creates a skill that summarizes the uncommitted changes in your git repository and flags anything risky. It pulls the live diff into the prompt before Claude reads it, so the response is grounded in your actual working tree rather than what Claude can guess from open files. Claude loads the skill automatically when you ask about your changes, or you can invoke it directly with `/summarize-changes`.


    Create a directory for the skill in your personal skills folder. Personal skills are available across all your projects.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/summarize-changes
    ```


    Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with two parts: YAML frontmatter between `---` markers that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with the instructions Claude follows when the skill runs. The directory name becomes the command you type, and the `description` helps Claude decide when to load the skill automatically.

    Save this to `~/.claude/skills/summarize-changes/SKILL.md`:

    ```yaml
    ---
    description: Summarizes uncommitted changes and flags anything risky. Use when the user asks what changed, wants a commit message, or asks to review their diff.
    ---

    ## Current changes

    !`git diff HEAD`

    ## Instructions

    Summarize the changes above in two or three bullet points, then list any risks you notice such as missing error handling, hardcoded values, or tests that need updating. If the diff is empty, say there are no uncommitted changes.
    ```

    The `` !`git diff HEAD` `` line uses [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context): Claude Code runs the command and replaces the line with its output before Claude sees the skill content, so the instructions arrive with the current diff already inlined.


    Open a git project, make a small edit to any file, and start Claude Code by running `claude`. You can test the skill two ways.

    **Let Claude invoke it automatically** by asking something that matches the description:

    ```text
    What did I change?
    ```

    **Or invoke it directly** with the skill name:

    ```text
    /summarize-changes
    ```

    Either way, Claude should respond with a short summary of your edit and a list of risks.


### Where skills live

Where you store a skill determines who can use it:

| Location   | Path                                                | Applies to                     |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Enterprise | See [managed settings](/docs/en/settings#settings-files) | All users in your organization |
| Personal   | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`            | All your projects              |
| Project    | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`              | This project only              |
| Plugin     | `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`             | Where plugin is enabled        |

When skills share the same name, Claude Code resolves the conflict by source:

* Across levels, enterprise overrides personal, and personal overrides project.
  * For example, with a `deploy` skill in both `~/.claude/skills/` and your project's `.claude/skills/`, `/deploy` runs the personal one.
* A skill at any of these levels also overrides a bundled skill with the same name, but not the bundled skill's aliases.
  * For example, a `code-review` skill in your project's `.claude/skills/` replaces the bundled `/code-review`, and typing the bundled alias `/review` never runs your skill.
* Plugin skills use a `plugin-name:skill-name` namespace, so they can't conflict with other levels.
  * For example, `my-plugin/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` becomes `/my-plugin:deploy` and loads alongside a `deploy` skill in your project's `.claude/skills/`.
* If you have files in `.claude/commands/`, those work the same way, but if a skill and a command share the same name, the skill takes precedence.
  * For example, with both `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md`, `/deploy` runs the skill.
* A skill or command from any of these sources overrides a skill [synced from your claude.ai account](#when-a-synced-skill-name-matches-another-command) with the same name.
  * For example, with a `deploy` skill enabled on claude.ai and another in your project's `.claude/skills/`, `/deploy` runs the project one.

Skills also load from nested `.claude/skills/` directories below your working directory. When Claude reads or edits a file in a subdirectory, skills from that subdirectory's `.claude/skills/` become available. This lets a monorepo package provide its own skills that apply when working on that package, even if the session started at the repo root.

If a nested skill shares a name with another skill, both stay available. For example, with a `deploy` skill at the project root and another in `apps/web/.claude/skills/`:

* The nested one appears under a directory-qualified name, `apps/web:deploy`.
* Its description says which directory it applies to.
* Claude picks the variant that matches the files it is working on.

Typing `/deploy` runs the project-root skill. Type the qualified name `/apps/web:deploy` to run the nested variant explicitly.

When you or Claude invoke the unqualified name, the project-root skill loads, and Claude Code appends a list of the directory-qualified variants to its content with an instruction to also invoke any variant whose directory holds the files Claude is working on. A nested skill therefore still applies to work in its directory when only the unqualified name is invoked.

The folder name `synced` is reserved in the enterprise, personal, and project skills locations, in any capitalization. Claude Code [downloads the skills you enable on claude.ai](/docs/en/env-vars#variables) into `~/.claude/skills/synced/` when `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS` is set in non-interactive mode, and skips a skill you author at that name.

A `<skill-name>` entry in the enterprise, personal, or project locations can be a symlink to a directory elsewhere on disk. Claude Code follows the symlink and reads `SKILL.md` from the target directory, and if the same target is reachable from more than one location, Claude Code loads the skill once. Plugin skills handle symlinks differently; see [Share files within a marketplace with symlinks](/docs/en/plugins-reference#share-files-within-a-marketplace-with-symlinks).


  Add a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to a skill folder and it loads as a [plugin](/docs/en/plugins-reference#skills-directory-plugins) named `<name>@skills-dir`, so it can bundle agents, hooks, and MCP servers. In a project's `.claude/skills/`, this requires accepting the workspace trust dialog first.


#### Live change detection

Claude Code watches skill directories for file changes. When you add, edit, or remove a skill under `~/.claude/skills/`, the project `.claude/skills/`, or a `.claude/skills/` inside an `--add-dir` directory, Claude Code picks up the change within the current session, without a restart. If you create a top-level skills directory that didn't exist when the session started, restart Claude Code so it can watch the new directory.


  Live change detection covers `SKILL.md` text only. For a skill folder that is also a [plugin](/docs/en/plugins-reference#skills-directory-plugins), changes to `hooks/`, `.mcp.json`, `agents/`, and `output-styles/` need `/reload-plugins` to take effect.


#### Discovery from parent and nested directories

Project skills load from `.claude/skills/` in the directory where you start Claude Code and in every parent directory up to the repository root. Starting Claude in a subdirectory still picks up skills defined at the root. To load skills from a directory outside that path at startup, pass it with [`--add-dir`](/docs/en/cli-reference). Claude Code reads `.claude/skills/` inside each added directory alongside the project skills.

Skills in nested `.claude/skills/` directories below your starting directory aren't loaded at startup. They load the first time Claude reads or edits a file inside that subdirectory, and stay available for the rest of the session. For example, after Claude edits a file under `packages/frontend/`, skills in `packages/frontend/.claude/skills/` become available. Until then, those skills don't appear in autocomplete and can't be invoked by name.

Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint:

```text theme={null}
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── template.md        # Template for Claude to fill in
├── examples/
│   └── sample.md      # Example output showing expected format
└── scripts/
    └── validate.sh    # Script Claude can execute
```

The `SKILL.md` contains the main instructions and is required. Other files are optional and let you build more powerful skills: templates for Claude to fill in, example outputs showing the expected format, scripts Claude can execute, or detailed reference documentation. Reference these files from your `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what they contain and when to load them. See [Add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) for more details.


  Files in `.claude/commands/` support the same [frontmatter](#frontmatter-reference), except `name` and `paths`, which Claude Code ignores in a command file. You invoke a command file by its file name. Skills are recommended since they support additional features like supporting files.


#### Skills from additional directories

The `--add-dir` flag and `/add-dir` command [grant file access](/docs/en/permissions#additional-directories-grant-file-access-not-configuration) rather than configuration discovery, but skills and commands are an exception: Claude Code loads `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/commands/` from each added directory automatically. This exception applies only to `--add-dir` and `/add-dir`. The `permissions.additionalDirectories` setting in `settings.json` grants file access only and doesn't load skills or commands. See [Live change detection](#live-change-detection) for how skill edits are picked up during a session.

Other `.claude/` configuration such as output styles is not loaded from additional directories. See the [exceptions table](/docs/en/permissions#additional-directories-grant-file-access-not-configuration) for the complete list of what is and isn't loaded, and the recommended ways to share configuration across projects.


  CLAUDE.md files from `--add-dir` directories are not loaded by default. To load them, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1`. See [Load from additional directories](/docs/en/memory#load-from-additional-directories).


#### Skills in Cowork and cloud sessions

[Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) sessions and [cloud sessions](/docs/en/cloud-environments#what-carries-over-from-your-setup), including [routines](/docs/en/routines), don't read `~/.claude/skills/` on your machine. Both interactive and scheduled Cowork sessions load the skills enabled for your claude.ai account, synced at session start; manage them from **Customize** in the Desktop app sidebar or from the skills settings on claude.ai. Cloud sessions additionally load project skills committed to the cloned repository's `.claude/skills/`.

If a skill exists only in `~/.claude/skills/` on your machine, Claude Code reports that the skill was not found when a [routine](/docs/en/routines) invokes it, because each routine run starts as a fresh remote session. To make a personal skill available in these sessions:

* For Cowork and cloud sessions, enable the skill for your claude.ai account.
* For cloud sessions, you can instead commit the skill to the repository's `.claude/skills/`, or ship it in a plugin declared in the repository's `.claude/settings.json`. Repo-declared plugins [install at session start](/docs/en/cloud-environments#what-carries-over-from-your-setup); plugins enabled only in your user settings don't transfer.

[Desktop scheduled tasks](/docs/en/desktop-scheduled-tasks) are different: they run locally on your machine and load skills from the same locations as any other local session.

<h3 id="how-synced-skills-behave">
  Skills synced from claude.ai
</h3>

This section applies to you if you enabled skills for your claude.ai account. In Cowork and cloud sessions, Claude Code loads those skills without any setup on your machine. In any other session on your machine, Claude Code loads them only after you turn syncing on with [`CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS`](/docs/en/env-vars#variables) in a non-interactive run, as [Where synced skills load](#where-synced-skills-load) describes.

Claude Code downloads a synced skill from your account rather than reading a file you wrote on the machine where the session runs, so it applies rules to synced skills that don't apply to the skills you store in the [skills locations](#where-skills-live).

#### Where synced skills load

In a Cowork or cloud session, Claude Code loads the skills enabled for your claude.ai account, and [Skills in Cowork and cloud sessions](#skills-in-cowork-and-cloud-sessions) says how to choose which skills those sessions get.

In any other session on your machine, Claude Code loads them only after you download them once in a non-interactive run:


    Enable each skill you want for your claude.ai account, as [Skills in Cowork and cloud sessions](#skills-in-cowork-and-cloud-sessions) describes. Claude Code downloads only the skills you enabled, and it needs your claude.ai sign-in to download them.


    Claude Code downloads synced skills only when you run it in [non-interactive mode](/docs/en/headless) with the `-p` flag and set [`CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS`](/docs/en/env-vars#variables) to `1`. The prompt you pass doesn't affect the download.

    ```bash
    CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS=1 claude -p "List the skills you have available"
    ```

    Claude Code downloads the skills into `~/.claude/skills/synced/`, answers the prompt, and exits like any other non-interactive run. The downloaded skills stay on disk after it exits, so you don't need to keep the run open. Claude Code downloads skills only during a run with `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS` set, so after you enable or change a skill on claude.ai, run the command again. To change how long the run waits for the sync before it answers the prompt, set [`CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`](/docs/en/env-vars#variables).


    Start an interactive session, without `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS` set, and run `/skills`. The menu lists the downloaded skills under `claude.ai sync`. Every local session you start afterwards loads them from `~/.claude/skills/synced/` too.


#### When a synced skill name matches another command

Claude Code skips a synced skill whose name matches any other command, and that other command runs. The other command can be a built-in command, a [bundled skill](#bundled-skills), a skill at any [local level](#where-skills-live), a plugin skill, a file in `.claude/commands/`, or an [MCP prompt](/docs/en/mcp#use-mcp-prompts-as-commands). Claude Code also reserves the names of its own built-in commands and bundled skills even when they're unavailable in your session, for example after you turn bundled skills off, so it skips a synced skill with one of those names too.

Claude Code labels synced skills so you can tell where they came from. The `/skills` menu and `/context` group synced skills under `claude.ai sync`, and the `/` command menu marks them as coming from claude.ai.

When it compares names, Claude Code ignores case, spacing, and invisible characters, and treats compatibility forms such as fullwidth letters and dash variants as their plain equivalents, so a synced `Commit` can't load beside a local `commit`. A name that differs only by a look-alike letter from another alphabet counts as a different name, and the `claude.ai sync` label is how you tell the two apart.

#### How Claude Code handles the frontmatter of a synced skill

Claude Code applies two rules to a synced skill's frontmatter:

* Claude Code honors the frontmatter in every kind of session, so an `allowed-tools` grant goes through the normal [permission flow](/docs/en/permissions).
* Claude Code sanitizes the display text the skill supplies, such as its description. It removes control characters, and in text that reaches Claude, such as the description, it also escapes angle brackets so the text can't imitate Claude Code's internal formatting.

#### How Claude Code handles the body of a synced skill

What Claude Code does with a synced skill's body depends on where the session runs:

* In a cloud session, the body keeps the behavior a local skill has, because the session runs in an isolated container.
* In a Cowork session on your desktop, the body keeps the behavior a local skill has, except that Claude Code replaces every `!` command line with the [`disableSkillShellExecution` placeholder](#inject-dynamic-context), as it does for every skill you supply there.
* In any other session on your machine, Claude Code doesn't run [`!` commands](#inject-dynamic-context), doesn't attach the files that `@` references name the way it does for a local skill, and doesn't substitute the `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` and `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` placeholders, so the `@` references and both placeholders reach Claude as literal text. A `!` command line reaches Claude as literal text too, or as that placeholder when `disableSkillShellExecution` is on.

## Configure skills

Skills are configured through YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md` and the markdown content that follows.

### Types of skill content

Skill files can contain any instructions, but thinking about how you want to invoke them helps guide what to include:

**Reference content** adds knowledge Claude applies to your current work. Conventions, patterns, style guides, domain knowledge. This content runs inline so Claude can use it alongside your conversation context.

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: api-conventions
description: API design patterns for this codebase
---

When writing API endpoints:
- Use RESTful naming conventions
- Return consistent error formats
- Include request validation
```

**Task content** gives Claude step-by-step instructions for a specific action, like deployments, commits, or code generation. These are often actions you want to invoke directly with `/skill-name` rather than letting Claude decide when to run them. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` to prevent Claude from triggering it automatically. The example below adds `context: fork`, which runs the skill in its own subagent context; see [Run skills in a subagent](#run-skills-in-a-subagent).

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy the application to production
context: fork
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Deploy the application:
1. Run the test suite
2. Build the application
3. Push to the deployment target
```

Keep the body itself concise. Once a skill loads, its content [stays in context across turns](#skill-content-lifecycle), so every line is a recurring token cost. State what to do rather than narrating how or why, and apply the same conciseness test you would for [CLAUDE.md content](/docs/en/best-practices#write-an-effective-claude-md).

### Frontmatter reference

Beyond the markdown content, you can configure skill behavior using YAML frontmatter fields between `---` markers at the top of your `SKILL.md` file:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Read Grep
---

Your skill instructions here...
```

All fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended so Claude knows when to use the skill.

Boolean fields accept `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `1`, and `0` in any letter case, in addition to `true` and `false`. Before v2.1.218, Claude Code recognized only `true` and `false`.

| Field                      | Required    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`                     | No          | Display name shown in skill listings. Defaults to the directory name. See [How a skill gets its command name](#how-a-skill-gets-its-command-name) for how the field interacts with the name you type to invoke the skill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `description`              | Recommended | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. If omitted, uses the first paragraph of markdown content. Put the key use case first: the combined `description` and `when_to_use` text is truncated at 1,536 characters in the skill listing to reduce context usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `when_to_use`              | No          | Additional context for when Claude should invoke the skill, such as trigger phrases or example requests. Appended to `description` in the skill listing and counts toward the 1,536-character cap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `argument-hint`            | No          | Hint shown during autocomplete to indicate expected arguments. Example: `[issue-number]` or `[filename] [format]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `arguments`                | No          | Named positional arguments for [`$name` substitution](#available-string-substitutions) in the skill content. Accepts a space-separated string or a YAML list. Names map to argument positions in order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No          | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from automatically loading this skill. Use for workflows you want to trigger manually with `/name`. Also prevents the skill from being [preloaded into subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents). As of v2.1.196, also prevents the skill from running when a [scheduled task](/docs/en/scheduled-tasks) fires with the skill as its prompt. Default: `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `user-invocable`           | No          | Set to `false` when only Claude should invoke the skill: Claude Code hides it from the `/` menu and doesn't run it when you type `/name`. Use for background knowledge users shouldn't invoke directly. Default: `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `allowed-tools`            | No          | Tools Claude can use without asking permission during the turn that invokes this skill. The grant clears when you send your next message. Accepts a space- or comma-separated string, or a YAML list. See [Pre-approve tools for a skill](#pre-approve-tools-for-a-skill).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `disallowed-tools`         | No          | Tools removed from Claude's available pool while this skill is active. Use for autonomous skills that should never call certain tools, such as `AskUserQuestion` for a background loop. Accepts a space- or comma-separated string, or a YAML list. The restriction clears when you send your next message. Like deny rules, the field can't remove [`EndConversation`](/docs/en/tools-reference#endconversation-tool-behavior) while any other tool remains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `model`                    | No          | Model to use when this skill is active. The override applies for the rest of the current turn and is not saved to settings; the session model resumes on your next prompt. Accepts the same values as [`/model`](/docs/en/model-config), or `inherit` to keep the active model. A value excluded by your organization's [`availableModels`](/docs/en/model-config#restrict-model-selection) allowlist is not used and the session keeps its current model. With `context: fork`, the value sets the [forked subagent's model](#run-skills-in-a-subagent) instead, and an excluded value follows the [same rules as a subagent model override](/docs/en/model-config#restrict-model-selection). |
| `effort`                   | No          | [Effort level](/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) when this skill is active. Overrides the session effort level. Default: inherits from session. Options: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`; available levels depend on the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `context`                  | No          | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context. See [Run skills in a subagent](#run-skills-in-a-subagent).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `agent`                    | No          | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `background`               | No          | Only applies with `context: fork`. Set to `false` to wait for the forked subagent's result in the turn that invoked the skill, instead of [running it in the background](#run-skills-in-a-subagent). Default: `true`. Requires Claude Code v2.1.218 or later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `hooks`                    | No          | Hooks that Claude Code registers when the skill is invoked and keeps running for the rest of the session. See [Hooks in skills and agents](/docs/en/hooks#hooks-in-skills-and-agents) for the configuration format and the `once` option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `paths`                    | No          | Glob patterns that limit when this skill is activated. Accepts a comma-separated string or a YAML list. When set, Claude loads the skill automatically only when working with files matching the patterns. Uses the same format as [path-specific rules](/docs/en/memory#path-specific-rules).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `shell`                    | No          | Shell to use for `` !`command` `` and ` ```! ` blocks in this skill. Accepts `bash` (default) or `powershell`. Setting `powershell` runs inline shell commands via PowerShell when the [PowerShell tool](/en/tools-reference#powershell-tool) is enabled: it's on by default on Windows without Git Bash, and `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1` enables it elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `metadata`                 | No          | Free-form YAML map for your own key-value data, such as entitlement or catalog fields, read by your own tooling from `SKILL.md`. Claude Code doesn't act on its contents, and drops a value that isn't a map. Don't reuse frontmatter field names such as `paths` as keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `license`                  | No          | License covering the skill. Part of the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) spec; see [Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code](#using-skill-frontmatter-outside-claude-code). Claude Code accepts the field but doesn't act on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `compatibility`            | No          | Environment requirements for the skill, such as intended products or system prerequisites, as defined by the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) spec; see [Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code](#using-skill-frontmatter-outside-claude-code). Accepts a string of up to 500 characters. Claude Code accepts the field but doesn't act on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code

Claude Code accepts every field in the table above. Outside Claude Code, you can use only the fields in the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) spec:

| Distribution path                                                                                                                             | Frontmatter fields you can use                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code skills at [any level](#where-skills-live), including [plugin](/docs/en/plugins) skills                                                 | Every field in the table above                                                 |
| claude.ai skill uploads, the Skills API, and packaging with `package_skill.py` from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` |

When you enable a personal skill for [Cowork and cloud sessions](#skills-in-cowork-and-cloud-sessions), including routines, you upload it to claude.ai, so the same rules apply.

If you include any field the spec doesn't allow, packaging or upload fails with a hard error instead of ignoring the field:

```
Unexpected key(s) in SKILL.md frontmatter: argument-hint. Allowed properties are: allowed-tools, compatibility, description, license, metadata, name
```

Restricting frontmatter to the spec's six fields avoids the unexpected-key error above. The [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io) and the [Skills API requirements](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills-guide) define everything else those paths validate. Claude Code-only body features, such as [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context), don't function in claude.ai chat or through the API. Claude Code accepts all six fields, so frontmatter that follows the spec loads in Claude Code without changes.

#### How a skill gets its command name

The command you type to invoke a skill comes from where the skill file lives and, for plugin skills, also from the frontmatter `name` field. In a personal or project skill, `name` sets only the display label shown in skill listings, and the command still comes from the directory name. In a plugin skill, `name` sets the last segment of the command and the plugin prefix stays in place.

The table below shows where the command name comes from for each layout:

| Skill location                                                                                     | Command name source                                                                | Example                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skill directory under `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`                                     | Directory name                                                                     | `.claude/skills/deploy-staging/SKILL.md` → `/deploy-staging`                                                                         |
| [Nested](#where-skills-live) `.claude/skills/` directory, when the name clashes with another skill | Subdirectory path relative to the working directory, then the skill directory name | `apps/web/.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` → `/apps/web:deploy`                                                                       |
| File under `.claude/commands/`                                                                     | File name without extension                                                        | `.claude/commands/deploy.md` → `/deploy`                                                                                             |
| Plugin `skills/` subdirectory                                                                      | Frontmatter `name` or the directory name, namespaced by plugin                     | `my-plugin/skills/review/SKILL.md` → `/my-plugin:review`, or `/my-plugin:fancy` with `name: fancy`                                   |
| Plugin root `SKILL.md`                                                                             | Frontmatter `name`, with the plugin directory name as a fallback                   | `my-plugin/SKILL.md` with `name: review` → `/my-plugin:review`. See [Path behavior rules](/docs/en/plugins-reference#path-behavior-rules) |

In a plugin skill, the frontmatter `name` replaces the directory name in the last segment of the command, so `my-plugin/skills/review/SKILL.md` with `name: fancy` becomes `/my-plugin:fancy`. The bare `/fancy` also invokes the skill unless another command already uses that name. Before v2.1.216, the frontmatter name replaced the whole command name, so the menu showed `/fancy` without the plugin prefix and `/my-plugin:fancy` didn't autocomplete.

In [non-interactive sessions](/docs/en/headless), Claude Code doesn't reserve the names `help` and `feedback` for their terminal-only built-in commands, so a plugin skill with one of those names keeps its bare command there. Claude Code still reserves the name of every other terminal-only built-in, such as `/login`, even though the command can't run in those sessions. In those sessions Claude Code also skips a synced skill named `help` or `feedback`, because it [skips a synced skill](#when-a-synced-skill-name-matches-another-command) whose name matches any built-in command whether or not that command can run. From v2.1.216 through v2.1.220, `help` and `feedback` were reserved too, so a plugin skill with one of those names was invocable only by its namespaced command in non-interactive sessions.

For a plugin-root `SKILL.md`, there is no skill directory to take the name from, so `name` supplies the whole final segment. Without a `name` field, Claude Code falls back to the plugin's directory name.

#### Available string substitutions

Skills support string substitution for dynamic values in the skill content:

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$ARGUMENTS`            | All arguments passed when invoking the skill. If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present in the content, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>`.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]`         | Access a specific argument by 0-based index, such as `$ARGUMENTS[0]` for the first argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `$N`                    | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]`, such as `$0` for the first argument or `$1` for the second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `$name`                 | Named argument declared in the [`arguments`](#frontmatter-reference) frontmatter list. Names map to positions in order, so with `arguments: [issue, branch]` the placeholder `$issue` expands to the first argument and `$branch` to the second.                                                            |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`  | The current session ID. Useful for logging, creating session-specific files, or correlating skill output with sessions.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `${CLAUDE_EFFORT}`      | The current effort level: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. Ultracode is not a distinct level and reports as `xhigh`. Use this to adapt skill instructions to the active effort setting.                                                                                                          |
| `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`   | The directory containing the skill's `SKILL.md` file. For plugin skills, this is the skill's subdirectory within the plugin, not the plugin root. Use this in bash injection commands to reference scripts or files bundled with the skill, regardless of the current working directory.                    |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` | The project root directory. This is the same path [hooks](/docs/en/hooks#reference-scripts-by-path) and MCP servers receive as `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. Use this to reference project-local scripts or files, such as `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/helper.sh`, independent of where the skill is installed. |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | The plugin's installation directory. Substituted only in plugin skills. Use this to reference scripts or files bundled anywhere in the plugin, including resources shared between the plugin's skills. See [plugin environment variables](/docs/en/plugins-reference#environment-variables).                     |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` | The plugin's [persistent data directory](/docs/en/plugins-reference#persistent-data-directory), which survives plugin updates. Substituted only in plugin skills. Use this to reference installed dependencies, generated files, or caches that must outlive an update.                                          |

Claude Code substitutes `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` and `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` in two places: the skill's markdown content, and Bash rules in the [`allowed-tools`](#frontmatter-reference) frontmatter. In a plugin skill, Claude Code substitutes `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` in the same two places. Using the same variable in both places lets a skill run a bundled script without a permission prompt. The following skill shows the pattern:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: render-chart
description: Render a chart from a CSV file
allowed-tools: Bash(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/render.sh *)
---

Run `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/render.sh <csv-file>` to render the chart.
```

If this skill is installed at `~/.claude/skills/render-chart/`, both occurrences of `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` expand to that directory. The `allowed-tools` rule then matches the exact command the skill body tells Claude to run, so the script runs without prompting.

The `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` substitution requires Claude Code v2.1.196 or later.

Indexed arguments use shell-style quoting, so wrap multi-word values in quotes to pass them as a single argument. For example, `/my-skill "hello world" second` makes `$0` expand to `hello world` and `$1` to `second`. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder always expands to the full argument string as typed.

An indexed placeholder with no corresponding argument, such as `$2` when only one argument was passed, stays in the content unchanged. A named placeholder from the [`arguments`](#frontmatter-reference) frontmatter with no matching argument expands to an empty string.

To include a literal `$` before a digit, `ARGUMENTS`, or a declared argument name, such as `$1.00` in prose, escape it with a backslash: `\$1.00`. A backslash before any other `$` is left unchanged. Only a single backslash directly before the token escapes it. A doubled backslash such as `\\$1` leaves both backslashes in place, and `$1` still expands to the argument value. The backslash escape covers only these argument placeholders. A backslash doesn't prevent substitution of a `${CLAUDE_*}` variable where the variable applies.

**Example using substitutions:**

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: session-logger
description: Log activity for this session
---

Log the following to logs/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.log:

$ARGUMENTS
```

### Add supporting files

Skills can include multiple files in their directory. This keeps `SKILL.md` focused on the essentials while letting Claude access detailed reference material only when needed. Large reference docs, API specifications, or example collections don't need to load into context every time the skill runs.

```text theme={null}
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)
├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)
├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)
```

Reference supporting files from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what each file contains and when to load it:

```markdown theme={null}
## Additional resources

- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)
```

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

### Control who invokes a skill

By default, both you and Claude can invoke any skill. You can type `/skill-name` to invoke it directly, and Claude can load it automatically when relevant to your conversation. Two frontmatter fields let you restrict this:

* **`disable-model-invocation: true`**: Only you can invoke the skill. Use this for workflows with side effects or that you want to control timing, like `/commit`, `/deploy`, or `/send-slack-message`. You don't want Claude deciding to deploy because your code looks ready.

* **`user-invocable: false`**: Only Claude can invoke the skill. Use this for background knowledge that isn't actionable as a command. A `legacy-system-context` skill explains how an old system works. Claude should know this when relevant, but `/legacy-system-context` isn't a meaningful action for users to take.

This example creates a deploy skill that only you can trigger. If you set `disable-model-invocation: true`, Claude can't run the skill automatically:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy the application to production
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Deploy $ARGUMENTS to production:

1. Run the test suite
2. Build the application
3. Push to the deployment target
4. Verify the deployment succeeded
```

If Claude tries anyway, Claude Code blocks the call and instructs it not to reproduce the deploy steps another way, so expect Claude to suggest running `/deploy` yourself.

Here's how the two fields affect invocation and context loading:

| Frontmatter                      | You can invoke | Claude can invoke | When loaded into context                                     |
| :------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| (default)                        | Yes            | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes            | No                | Description not in context, full skill loads when you invoke |
| `user-invocable: false`          | No             | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |


  In a regular session, skill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available, but full skill content only loads when invoked. [Subagents with preloaded skills](/docs/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents) work differently: the full skill content is injected at startup.


### Skill content lifecycle

When you or Claude invoke a skill, the rendered `SKILL.md` content enters the conversation as a single message and stays there for the rest of the session. This persistence applies to the skill's instructions, not its permissions: an [`allowed-tools`](#pre-approve-tools-for-a-skill) grant clears when you send your next message. Claude Code does not re-read the skill file on later turns, so write guidance that should apply throughout a task as standing instructions rather than one-time steps.

When Claude re-invokes a skill whose rendered content is identical to the copy already in context, Claude Code adds a short note that the skill is already loaded rather than a second copy of the content. When the rendered content differs, because the arguments changed or a [dynamic context](#inject-dynamic-context) command produced new output, Claude Code appends the full content again.

[Auto-compaction](/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#when-context-fills-up) carries invoked skills forward within a token budget. When the conversation is summarized to free context, Claude Code re-attaches the most recent invocation of each skill after the summary, keeping the first 5,000 tokens of each. Re-attached skills share a combined budget of 25,000 tokens. Claude Code fills this budget starting from the most recently invoked skill, so older skills can be dropped entirely after compaction if you have invoked many in one session.

If a skill seems to stop influencing behavior after the first response, the content is usually still present and the model is choosing other tools or approaches. Strengthen the skill's `description` and instructions so the model keeps preferring it, or use [hooks](/docs/en/hooks) to enforce behavior deterministically. If the skill is large or you invoked several others after it, re-invoke it after compaction to restore the full content.

### Pre-approve tools for a skill

The `allowed-tools` field grants permission for the listed tools during the turn that invokes the skill, so Claude can use them without prompting you for approval. The grant clears when you send your next message, even though the skill content [stays in context](#skill-content-lifecycle); invoking the skill again re-applies it for that turn. It does not restrict which tools are available: every tool remains callable, and your [permission settings](/docs/en/permissions) still govern tools that are not listed. To pre-approve tools for the whole session rather than a single turn, add allow rules to those permission settings instead.

Workspace trust doesn't gate this field. Claude Code applies a project skill's `allowed-tools` whenever you or Claude invoke the skill, including in a `-p` run in a folder you've never trusted. A skill can grant itself broad tool access, so review the `allowed-tools` of skills checked into a repository before you run Claude Code there.

This skill lets Claude run git commands without per-use approval whenever you invoke it:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: commit
description: Stage and commit the current changes
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Bash(git add *) Bash(git commit *) Bash(git status *)
---
```

To remove tools from Claude's available pool while a skill is active, list them in `disallowed-tools` in the skill's frontmatter. The restriction clears when you send your next message. Like deny rules, the field can't remove [`EndConversation`](/docs/en/tools-reference#endconversation-tool-behavior) while any other tool remains. To block tools across all skills and prompts, add deny rules in your [permission settings](/docs/en/permissions).

### Pass arguments to skills

Both you and Claude can pass arguments when invoking a skill. Arguments are available via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

This skill fixes a GitHub issue by number. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder gets replaced with whatever follows the skill name:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: fix-issue
description: Fix a GitHub issue
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Fix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.

1. Read the issue description
2. Understand the requirements
3. Implement the fix
4. Write tests
5. Create a commit
```

When you run `/fix-issue 123`, Claude receives "Fix GitHub issue 123 following our coding standards..."

If you invoke a skill with arguments but the skill doesn't include `$ARGUMENTS`, Claude Code appends `ARGUMENTS: <your input>` to the end of the skill content so Claude still sees what you typed.

You can also stack several skills at the start of one message. Typing `/write-tests /fix-issue 123` loads both skills and passes the trailing text `123` as `$ARGUMENTS` to each of them. Before v2.1.199, only the first skill loaded and received `/fix-issue 123` as literal argument text.

Claude Code expands the first skill plus up to five more stacked after it. Expansion stops at the first token that isn't an inline user-invocable skill, so a skill that runs as a [forked subagent](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), such as [`/code-review`](/docs/en/code-review#review-a-diff-locally), or one whose arguments may themselves start with a slash command, such as `/loop`, also ends the run there. That token and everything after it become the argument text for every expanded skill. `/code-review` runs as a forked subagent from v2.1.218; on earlier versions it ran inline and stacked.

To access individual arguments by position, use `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or the shorter `$N`:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
---

Migrate the $ARGUMENTS[0] component from $ARGUMENTS[1] to $ARGUMENTS[2].
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```

Running `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$ARGUMENTS[0]` with `SearchBar`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]` with `React`, and `$ARGUMENTS[2]` with `Vue`. The same skill using the `$N` shorthand:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
---

Migrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```

## Advanced patterns

### Inject dynamic context

The `` !`<command>` `` syntax runs shell commands before the skill content is sent to Claude. The command output replaces the placeholder, so Claude receives actual data, not the command itself. Claude Code doesn't run these commands on your machine when the skill is [synced from your claude.ai account](#how-claude-code-handles-the-body-of-a-synced-skill).

This skill summarizes a pull request by fetching live PR data with the GitHub CLI. The `` !`gh pr diff` `` and other commands run first, and their output gets inserted into the prompt:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: pr-summary
description: Summarize changes in a pull request
context: fork
agent: Explore
allowed-tools: Bash(gh *)
---

## Pull request context
- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`
- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`

## Your task
Summarize this pull request...
```

Substitution runs once over the original file. Command output is inserted as plain text and is not re-scanned for further `` !`<command>` `` placeholders, so a command cannot emit a placeholder for a later pass to expand.

The inline form is only recognized when `!` appears at the start of a line or immediately after whitespace. If `!` follows another character, as in `` KEY=!`cmd` ``, the placeholder is left as literal text and the command does not run.

For multi-line commands, use a fenced code block opened with ` ```! ` instead of the inline form:

````markdown theme={null}
## Environment
```!
node --version
npm --version
git status --short
```
````

To disable this behavior for skills and custom commands from user, project, plugin, or [additional-directory](#skills-from-additional-directories) sources, set `"disableSkillShellExecution": true` in [settings](/docs/en/settings). Each command is replaced with `[shell command execution disabled by policy]` instead of being run. Bundled and managed skills are not affected. This setting is most useful in [managed settings](/docs/en/permissions#managed-settings), where users cannot override it.

Claude Code never runs these commands on your machine when they appear in skills [synced from your claude.ai account](#how-synced-skills-behave), regardless of this setting. [How Claude Code handles the body of a synced skill](#how-claude-code-handles-the-body-of-a-synced-skill) says what Claude receives in place of the command in each kind of session.

<Tip>
  To request deeper reasoning when a skill runs, include `ultrathink` anywhere in the skill content. See [Use ultrathink for one-off deep reasoning](/docs/en/model-config#use-ultrathink-for-one-off-deep-reasoning).
</Tip>

#### How injected commands run

Claude Code picks the tool that runs a skill's injected commands from the `shell` key in the skill's frontmatter and your environment. Every combination runs the commands through the Bash tool or the PowerShell tool, except one that fails the invocation outright:

* `shell: powershell`, with the [PowerShell tool](/docs/en/tools-reference#powershell-tool) enabled: the commands run through the PowerShell tool.
* `shell: bash` when bash isn't available: the invocation fails before any command runs. This happens on Windows without Git Bash. Claude Code shows ``Skill <name> requires bash (`shell: bash` in frontmatter) but Git Bash was not found``.
* Any other combination: the commands run through the Bash tool when bash is available. When it isn't, they run through the PowerShell tool.

Either tool runs the commands the same way it runs Claude's own shell commands. They share the working directory, timeout, and output handling:

* **Working directory**: Claude Code runs each command in the session shell's current working directory. That directory moves when Claude runs `cd`. Use [`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` or `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`](#available-string-substitutions) in paths that must resolve the same way every time.
* **stderr**: with the default `bash` shell, Claude Code merges stderr into stdout. Anything the command writes to stderr appears in the injected text.
* **Timeout**: each command runs under the Bash tool's default 2-minute [timeout](/docs/en/tools-reference#timeout-and-output-limits). When the Bash tool [moves a timed-out command to the background](/docs/en/tools-reference#background-commands), the skill still renders. The injected text reports the move and names the background task and the file collecting the command's output. When the command is one the Bash tool never auto-backgrounds, Claude Code kills it at the timeout. That failure [aborts the invocation](#when-an-injected-command-fails).
* **Output size**: output past the Bash tool's inline ceiling arrives as a file path plus a short preview, not truncated text. [Output limits](/docs/en/tools-reference#output-limits) covers the ceiling and which variable adjusts which boundary.

The PowerShell tool applies the same timeout, backgrounding, and output-ceiling behavior to the commands it runs. See the [PowerShell tool](/docs/en/tools-reference#powershell-tool) section for its specifics.

#### When an injected command fails

A failed command aborts the entire skill invocation, not just its own placeholder. Claude never sees the skill content for that invocation. The abort shows `Shell command failed for pattern "..."`. The error message includes the command's output under `[stderr]`.

With the default `bash` shell, any non-zero exit code counts as a failure. One carveout applies: Claude Code treats exit code 1 from [search and comparison commands](/docs/en/tools-reference#output-limits) as a normal result and injects their output. Exit codes of 2 or higher fail even for those commands.

Which commands get the carveout depends on the shell:

* Default `bash` shell: the commands listed under [Output limits](/docs/en/tools-reference#output-limits)
* `shell: powershell`, when the PowerShell tool is enabled: a [different set](/docs/en/tools-reference#shell-selection-in-settings-hooks-and-skills) that includes `grep` and `git diff` but not `find` or `diff`

With the default `bash` shell, append `|| true` to any other command you expect to exit non-zero. A check script that exits 1 when it finds problems is one example.

Injected commands never prompt for permission. When a command's permission check returns anything other than allow, Claude Code aborts the invocation. This includes a rule that would normally ask you. The abort shows `Shell command permission check failed for pattern "..."`.

To keep an unmatched command from aborting here, pre-approve it with [`allowed-tools`](#pre-approve-tools-for-a-skill). A matching ask or deny rule still aborts the invocation regardless of `allowed-tools`. See [Manage permissions](/docs/en/permissions#manage-permissions).

### Run skills in a subagent

Add `context: fork` to your frontmatter when you want a skill to run in isolation. The skill content becomes the prompt that drives the subagent. It won't have access to your conversation history.

The forked subagent runs in the [background](/docs/en/sub-agents#run-subagents-in-foreground-or-background): you keep working while it runs, and its result arrives in your conversation when it completes. Set `background: false` in the frontmatter to instead wait for the result in the turn that invoked the skill. Before v2.1.218, forked skills always blocked the turn until they finished.

Claude Code also waits for the result, even when the skill doesn't set `background: false`, in cases like these:

* In non-interactive mode, with the `-p` flag or the Agent SDK
* When you set [`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS`](/docs/en/env-vars) to `1`, which also turns off all other background task features
* When you invoke a forked skill while an earlier invocation of the same skill is still running
* When a [scheduled task](/docs/en/scheduled-tasks) fires with the skill as its prompt

A backgrounded fork also runs with the [narrower tool set that applies to background subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents#run-subagents-in-foreground-or-background): the skill's subagent is a regular agent type, so the exemption for subagents that fork the conversation doesn't cover it. If your skill's steps depend on a tool outside that set, set `background: false` to keep the full tool set.

A forked skill that runs in the background applies its edits outside your session's [checkpoints](/docs/en/checkpointing), so `/rewind` doesn't undo them; use git to revert them.

<Warning>
  `context: fork` only makes sense for skills with explicit instructions. If your skill contains guidelines like "use these API conventions" without a task, the subagent receives the guidelines but no actionable prompt, and returns without meaningful output.
</Warning>

Skills and [subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents) work together in two directions:

| Approach                     | System prompt            | Task                        | Also loads                                          |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Skill with `context: fork`   | From agent type          | SKILL.md content            | CLAUDE.md, except when the agent is Explore or Plan |
| Subagent with `skills` field | Subagent's markdown body | Claude's delegation message | Preloaded skills + CLAUDE.md                        |

With `context: fork`, you write the task in your skill and pick an agent type to execute it. The built-in Explore and Plan agents [skip CLAUDE.md and git status](/docs/en/sub-agents#what-loads-at-startup) to keep their context small, so a forked skill using `agent: Explore` sees only the SKILL.md content and the agent's own system prompt. For the inverse, where you define a custom subagent that uses skills as reference material, see [Subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents).

#### Example: Research skill using Explore agent

This skill runs research in a forked Explore agent. The skill content becomes the task, and the agent provides read-only tools optimized for codebase exploration:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: deep-research
description: Research a topic thoroughly
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

Research $ARGUMENTS thoroughly:

1. Find relevant files using Glob and Grep
2. Read and analyze the code
3. Summarize findings with specific file references
```

When this skill runs:

1. A new isolated context is created
2. The subagent receives the skill content as its prompt ("Research \$ARGUMENTS thoroughly...")
3. The `agent` field determines the execution environment (model, tools, and permissions)
4. The subagent summarizes its results and returns them to your main conversation when it finishes

The `agent` field specifies which subagent configuration to use. Options include built-in agents (`Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`) or any custom subagent from `.claude/agents/`. If omitted, uses `general-purpose`.

### Restrict Claude's skill access

By default, Claude can invoke any skill that doesn't have `disable-model-invocation: true` set. Skills that define `allowed-tools` grant Claude access to those tools without per-use approval during the turn that invokes the skill; the grant clears when you send your next message. Your [permission settings](/docs/en/permissions) still govern baseline approval behavior for all other tools. A few built-in commands are also available through the Skill tool, including `/init` and `/security-review`. Other built-in commands such as `/compact` are not.

Three ways to control which skills Claude can invoke:

**Disable all skills** by denying the Skill tool in `/permissions`:

```text theme={null}
# Add to deny rules:
Skill
```

**Allow or deny specific skills** using [permission rules](/docs/en/permissions):

```text theme={null}
# Allow only specific skills
Skill(commit)
Skill(review-pr *)

# Deny specific skills
Skill(deploy *)
```

Permission syntax: `Skill(name)` for exact match, `Skill(name *)` for prefix match with any arguments.

**Hide individual skills** by adding `disable-model-invocation: true` to their frontmatter. This removes the skill from Claude's context entirely.


  With `user-invocable: false`, you can't invoke the skill, but Claude still can. To keep Claude from invoking it through the Skill tool, set `disable-model-invocation: true`.


### Override skill visibility from settings

The `skillOverrides` setting controls skill visibility from your [settings](/docs/en/settings) instead of the skill's own frontmatter. Use it for skills whose SKILL.md you don't want to edit, such as ones checked into a shared project repo. The `/skills` menu writes it for you: highlight a skill and press `Space` to cycle states, then `Enter` to save to `.claude/settings.local.json`.

Each key is a skill name and each value is one of four states:

| Value                   | Listed to Claude     | In `/` menu |
| :---------------------- | :------------------- | :---------- |
| `"on"`                  | Name and description | Yes         |
| `"name-only"`           | Name only            | Yes         |
| `"user-invocable-only"` | Hidden               | Yes         |
| `"off"`                 | Hidden               | Hidden      |

The `/skills` menu labels the `"user-invocable-only"` state `user-only`.

As of v2.1.199, `"off"` also hides the skill from the command lists advertised to [Remote Control](/docs/en/remote-control) clients and to [Agent SDK](/docs/en/agent-sdk/slash-commands) callers, in addition to the terminal `/` menu. Invoking a hidden skill by its full name still returns the `skillOverrides` error instead of running it.

A skill that is absent from `skillOverrides` is treated as `"on"`. The example below collapses one skill to its name and turns another off entirely:

```json theme={null}
{
  "skillOverrides": {
    "legacy-context": "name-only",
    "deploy": "off"
  }
}
```

Plugin skills are not affected by `skillOverrides`. Manage those through `/plugin` instead.

## Evaluate and iterate on a skill

Seeing a skill trigger tells you Claude found it, not that it did what you intended. To know a skill is working, measure two things separately: whether Claude invokes it on the prompts it should, and whether the output matches what you expect when it does.

The check for both is a baseline comparison. Collect a few realistic prompts, run each one in a fresh session with the skill available and again with it [disabled](#override-skill-visibility-from-settings), and compare the results. A fresh session matters because leftover context from authoring the skill will mask gaps in the written instructions.

### Run evals with skill-creator

The [`skill-creator` plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/skill-creator) automates the comparison loop inside Claude Code. Install it from the official marketplace:

```text theme={null}
/plugin install skill-creator@claude-plugins-official
```

If the install fails, match the message Claude Code reports:

* `Marketplace "claude-plugins-official" not found`: add the marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official`, then retry the install.
* The plugin is [not found in the marketplace](/docs/en/discover-plugins#install-plugins): check the plugin name.

If the install summary reports `Run /reload-plugins to activate.`, run that command to make the plugin's skills available in the current session. Then ask Claude to evaluate an existing skill, for example `evaluate my summarize-changes skill with skill-creator`. The plugin walks you through writing test cases and runs the loop:

* **Test cases**: stores prompts, input files, and expected behavior in `evals/evals.json` inside the skill directory
* **Isolated runs**: spawns a [subagent](/docs/en/sub-agents) per test case so each run starts with a clean context, and records token count and duration
* **Grading**: checks each assertion against the output and writes pass or fail with evidence to `grading.json`
* **Benchmark**: aggregates pass rate, time, and tokens for with-skill versus without-skill into `benchmark.json` so you can compare the pass-rate improvement against the token and time overhead
* **Version comparison**: runs a blind A/B between two versions of the skill so you can confirm an edit is an improvement before committing it
* **Description tuning**: generates should-trigger and should-not-trigger prompts, measures the hit rate, and proposes description edits when the skill activates on the wrong requests
* **Review viewer**: opens an HTML report where you inspect each output and record qualitative feedback that the next iteration reads

For the eval file format and the full iteration workflow, see [Evaluating skill output quality](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills) on agentskills.io. For background on the benchmark and comparison modes, see the [skill-creator announcement](https://claude.com/blog/improving-skill-creator-test-measure-and-refine-agent-skills).

## Share skills

Skills can be distributed at different scopes depending on your audience:

* **Project skills**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to version control
* **Plugins**: Create a `skills/` directory in your [plugin](/docs/en/plugins)
* **Managed**: Deploy organization-wide through [managed settings](/docs/en/settings#settings-files)

### Generate visual output

Skills can bundle and run scripts in any language, giving Claude capabilities beyond what's possible in a single prompt. One powerful pattern is generating visual output: interactive HTML files that open in your browser for exploring data, debugging, or creating reports.

This example creates a codebase explorer: an interactive tree view where you can expand and collapse directories, see file sizes at a glance, and identify file types by color.

Create the Skill directory:

```bash theme={null}
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts
```

Save this to `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/SKILL.md`. The description tells Claude when to activate this Skill, and the instructions tell Claude to run the bundled script. The script path uses [`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`](#available-string-substitutions) so it resolves correctly whether the skill is installed at the personal, project, or plugin level:

````yaml theme={null}
---
name: codebase-visualizer
description: Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of your codebase. Use when exploring a new repo, understanding project structure, or identifying large files.
allowed-tools: Bash(python3 *)
---

# Codebase Visualizer

Generate an interactive HTML tree view that shows your project's file structure with collapsible directories.

## Usage

Run the visualization script from your project root:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/visualize.py .
```

This creates `codebase-map.html` in the current directory and opens it in your default browser.

## What the visualization shows

- **Collapsible directories**: Click folders to expand/collapse
- **File sizes**: Displayed next to each file
- **Colors**: Different colors for different file types
- **Directory totals**: Shows aggregate size of each folder
````

Save this to `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py`. This script scans a directory tree and generates a self-contained HTML file with:

* A **summary sidebar** showing file count, directory count, total size, and number of file types
* A **bar chart** breaking down the codebase by file type (top 8 by size)
* A **collapsible tree** where you can expand and collapse directories, with color-coded file type indicators

The script requires Python 3 but uses only built-in libraries, so there are no packages to install:

```python expandable theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of a codebase."""

To test, open Claude Code in any project and ask "Visualize this codebase." Claude runs the script, which prints the generated file's path, such as `Generated /path/to/codebase-map.html`, and opens it in your browser. If you work in a headless environment where no browser opens, the printed path confirms the script succeeded.

This pattern works for any visual output: dependency graphs, test coverage reports, API documentation, or database schema visualizations. The bundled script does the work while Claude handles orchestration.

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not triggering

If Claude doesn't use your skill when expected:

1. Check the description includes keywords users would naturally say
2. Verify the skill appears in `What skills are available?`
3. Try rephrasing your request to match the description more closely
4. Invoke it directly with `/skill-name` if the skill is user-invocable

If the frontmatter YAML is malformed, Claude Code loads the skill body with empty metadata, so `/skill-name` still works but Claude has no `description` to match against. Run with `--debug` to see the parse error.

### Skill triggers too often

If Claude uses your skill when you don't want it:

1. Make the description more specific
2. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` if you only want manual invocation

### Skill descriptions are cut short

Claude Code loads a listing of skill names and descriptions into context so Claude knows what's available. The listing always contains every skill name, but if you have many skills, Claude Code shortens descriptions to fit the listing's character budget, which can strip the keywords Claude needs to match your request. The budget scales at 1% of the model's context window. When the listing overflows, Claude Code drops descriptions starting with the skills you invoke least, so the skills you use most keep their full text.

Run `/doctor` for an estimate of the listing's context cost and its biggest contributors. When the listing exceeds its budget, Claude Code also writes a warning to the debug log, visible with [`--debug`](/docs/en/cli-reference#cli-flags).

The Skills row in `/context` reports the size of the listing after the budget is applied, so it matches what the model receives. Before v2.1.196, the row counted the full text of every description and could show a value several times larger than the configured budget.

To raise the budget, set the [`skillListingBudgetFraction`](/docs/en/settings#available-settings) setting (e.g. `0.02` = 2%) or the `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable to a fixed character count. To free budget for other skills, set low-priority entries to `"name-only"` in [`skillOverrides`](#override-skill-visibility-from-settings) so they list without a description. You can also trim the `description` and `when_to_use` text at the source: put the key use case first, since each entry's combined text is capped at 1,536 characters regardless of budget. The cap is configurable with [`skillListingMaxDescChars`](/docs/en/settings#available-settings).
