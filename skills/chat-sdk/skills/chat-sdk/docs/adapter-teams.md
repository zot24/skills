# Microsoft Teams


## Install


## Quick start


  The adapter auto-detects `TEAMS_APP_ID`, `TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD`, and `TEAMS_APP_TENANT_ID` from the environment.


```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createTeamsAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/teams";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    teams: createTeamsAdapter({
      appType: "SingleTenant",
    }),
  },
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post("Hello from Teams!");
});
```

## Configuration


`appId` is required, along with one authentication method (`appPassword`, `federated`, or `token`). If more than one is configured, `token` takes precedence over `federated`, which takes precedence over `appPassword`.

## Authentication

The [Teams CLI](https://microsoft.github.io/teams-sdk/cli) handles AAD app registration, client secret generation, bot registration, and Teams channel setup in one command.

### Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/teams.cli
```

### 1. Create the app

```bash
teams login
teams status
teams app create --name "My Bot" --endpoint "https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/teams" --env .env
```


  For local development, use a tunnel (e.g. [devtunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/), ngrok) to expose your local server.


Credentials (`CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `TENANT_ID`) are written to `.env`. Rename them to match the adapter:

```bash
TEAMS_APP_ID=<CLIENT_ID>
TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD=<CLIENT_SECRET>
TEAMS_APP_TENANT_ID=<TENANT_ID>
```

### 2. Install in Teams

Get a direct install link:

```bash
teams app get <appId> --install-link
```

Or download the app package for sideloading and upload via **Apps** then **Manage your apps** then **Upload an app** then **Upload a custom app**.

### 3. Verify

```bash
teams app doctor <appId>
```

### Authentication methods

**Client secret (default)** — provide `appPassword` or set `TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD`:

```typescript
createTeamsAdapter({
  appPassword: "your_app_password_here",
});
```

**Federated (workload identity)** — for environments with managed identities (e.g. AKS, GitHub Actions). Maps to `managedIdentityClientId` in the Teams SDK:

```typescript
createTeamsAdapter({
  federated: {
    clientId: "your_managed_identity_client_id_here",
  },
});
```

**Custom token factory** — for runtimes without access to Azure IMDS (e.g. serverless platforms), provide your own token-minting logic. Maps to `AppOptions.token` in the Teams SDK:

```typescript
createTeamsAdapter({
  appId: "your_app_id_here",
  appTenantId: "your_tenant_id_here",
  token: async (scope, tenantId) => {
    // fetch or mint an access token for the given scope/tenant however your
    // runtime supports it (e.g. a workload-identity federation bridge)
    return await getAccessToken(scope, tenantId);
  },
});
```


  The Teams SDK reads a generic `CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable and prefers it over the token factory. Make sure `CLIENT_SECRET` is not set in your deployment environment, or the bot will silently fall back to client-secret auth.


## Advanced

### Conversation routing

Incoming thread IDs preserve the Teams conversation type when the legacy ID-prefix heuristic would route it incorrectly. This keeps correctly classified IDs stable while selecting the buffered fallback for group chats whose IDs begin with `a:`. Thread IDs created by older adapter versions remain supported.

### Incoming attachments

Incoming inline images and files are exposed through `message.attachments` with a lazy `fetchData()` method. The adapter authenticates connector-hosted inline attachments through the configured Teams bot client, while [Teams file download cards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/bots-filesv4) use their direct download URL without the bot token.

### User lookup

The adapter supports looking up user profiles via the Microsoft Graph API. To enable it:

1. Grant the `User.Read.All` **application permission** in your Azure AD app registration.
2. Grant admin consent for the permission.

```typescript
const user = await bot.getUser(message.author);
console.log(user?.email);    // "alice@contoso.com"
console.log(user?.fullName); // "Alice Smith"
```

The adapter caches each user's Azure AD object ID from incoming activities, so `getUser` only works for users who have previously interacted with the bot.

### Targeted / ephemeral messages

Teams targeted messages are available in public preview. Use `thread.postEphemeral()` or `channel.postEphemeral()` to send a native Teams message that only the selected conversation member can see:

```typescript
await thread.postEphemeral(message.author, "Only you can see this.", {
  fallbackToDM: false,
});
```

The result has `usedFallback: false` when Teams accepts the targeted message.

### Message history

Fetching message history requires `TEAMS_APP_TENANT_ID` and the right permissions depending on the conversation type:

| Context    | Permission                  | Type     | Admin consent? |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Channel    | `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` | RSC      | No             |
| Group chat | `ChatMessage.Read.Chat`     | RSC      | No             |
| DM         | `Chat.Read.All`             | Azure AD | Yes            |

RSC permissions are set via the Teams CLI (no admin consent needed):

```bash
teams app rsc add <appId> ChannelMessage.Read.Group --type Application
teams app rsc add <appId> ChatMessage.Read.Chat --type Application
```

For DM message history, RSC is not sufficient. Add `Chat.Read.All` via the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/):

```bash
az ad app permission add \
  --id <appId> \
  --api 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 \
  --api-permissions 6b7d71aa-70aa-4810-a8d9-5d9fb2830017=Role

az ad app permission admin-consent --id <appId>
```

### Receiving all messages

By default, Teams bots only receive messages when directly @-mentioned. The RSC permissions above also enable receiving all messages in channels and group chats as a side effect.

### Troubleshooting

Run `teams app doctor <appId>` to diagnose common issues — bot registration, AAD app health, manifest consistency, and endpoint reachability.

## Low-level APIs

Use the low-level Teams subpaths when your app already owns routing, state, sessions, or workflow execution and only needs Teams-specific primitives.

| Subpath                       | Use for                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@chat-adapter/teams/webhook` | Parse Bot Framework Activity JSON, classify common payloads, and extract continuation data |
| `@chat-adapter/teams/api`     | Fetch-based Bot Connector calls for messages, updates, deletes, typing, and conversations  |
| `@chat-adapter/teams/graph`   | Fetch-based Microsoft Graph reads for chats, channels, channel messages, and replies       |
| `@chat-adapter/teams/format`  | Teams HTML, mention, Markdown-ish, and emoji string helpers                                |
| `@chat-adapter/teams/cards`   | Runtime-free conversion from simple card objects and input requests to Adaptive Cards      |
| `@chat-adapter/teams/modals`  | Runtime-free Task Module Adaptive Card helpers and submit parsing                          |


  The webhook subpath parses Activities only. It does not verify Microsoft Bot Framework JWTs. For production request validation, use `createTeamsAdapter` or the Microsoft Teams SDK request pipeline before handing the Activity to these helpers.


### Webhooks

Teams sends Bot Framework Activity JSON. `readTeamsWebhook` reads the request body and classifies the Activity, but it intentionally does not perform JWT validation.

```typescript title="app/api/teams/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { postTeamsMessage } from "@chat-adapter/teams/api";
import { readTeamsWebhook } from "@chat-adapter/teams/webhook";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const payload = await readTeamsWebhook(request, {
    botAppId: process.env.TEAMS_APP_ID,
  });

  if (payload.kind === "message") {
    await postTeamsMessage({
      conversationId: payload.continuation.conversationId,
      credentials: {
        appId: process.env.TEAMS_APP_ID!,
        appPassword: process.env.TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD!,
        tenantId: payload.continuation.tenantId,
      },
      markdownText: `received: ${payload.text}`,
      serviceUrl: payload.continuation.serviceUrl,
    });
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

`parseTeamsWebhookBody` returns typed payloads:

| Kind                  | Teams surface                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `message`             | Message activities                                           |
| `message_reaction`    | Reaction activities                                          |
| `card_action`         | Adaptive Card actions and `Action.Submit` message activities |
| `dialog_open`         | Task Module `task/fetch` invokes                             |
| `dialog_submit`       | Task Module `task/submit` invokes                            |
| `conversation_update` | Conversation membership and install context updates          |
| `installation_update` | App installation updates                                     |
| `unsupported`         | Valid Activities not normalized by this helper yet           |

Message-like payloads include `continuation`, which contains provider-native reply context:

```typescript
type TeamsContinuation = {
  activityId?: string;
  channelId?: string;
  conversationId: string;
  replyToId?: string;
  serviceUrl: string;
  teamId?: string;
  tenantId?: string;
};
```

This is not a Chat SDK `Thread`. It is the durable Teams data you need to reply later with `@chat-adapter/teams/api`.

### Bot Connector API

The API subpath calls the Bot Framework Connector REST API with `fetch`. It does not import `@microsoft/teams.apps`.

```typescript title="teams.ts" lineNumbers
import {
  deleteTeamsMessage,
  postTeamsMessage,
  sendTeamsTyping,
  updateTeamsMessage,
} from "@chat-adapter/teams/api";

const credentials = {
  appId: process.env.TEAMS_APP_ID!,
  appPassword: process.env.TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD!,
  tenantId: process.env.TEAMS_APP_TENANT_ID!,
};

const posted = await postTeamsMessage({
  conversationId: "19:abc@thread.tacv2",
  credentials,
  markdownText: "**hello**",
  serviceUrl: "https://smba.trafficmanager.net/teams/",
});

await updateTeamsMessage({
  conversationId: "19:abc@thread.tacv2",
  credentials,
  messageId: posted.id,
  serviceUrl: "https://smba.trafficmanager.net/teams/",
  text: "updated",
});

await sendTeamsTyping({
  conversationId: "19:abc@thread.tacv2",
  credentials,
  serviceUrl: "https://smba.trafficmanager.net/teams/",
});

await deleteTeamsMessage({
  conversationId: "19:abc@thread.tacv2",
  credentials,
  messageId: posted.id,
  serviceUrl: "https://smba.trafficmanager.net/teams/",
});
```

Use `accessToken` in `credentials` when your runtime already owns Microsoft token acquisition. A direct `accessToken` must be scoped for the API you call it against — the Bot Connector subpath (`/api`) needs a `https://api.botframework.com/.default` token, while the Graph subpath (`/graph`) needs a `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` token. Passing the same token to both will fail against one of them. When you supply `appId`/`appPassword` instead, each subpath requests the correct scope for you.

### Graph

The Graph subpath reads Teams history with explicit Graph IDs. Unlike `TeamsAdapter`, it does not use the adapter state cache to infer `teamId`, `channelId`, or `chatId`.

```typescript
import { listTeamsChannelMessages } from "@chat-adapter/teams/graph";

const messages = await listTeamsChannelMessages({
  channelId: "19:channel@thread.tacv2",
  credentials: {
    appId: process.env.TEAMS_APP_ID!,
    appPassword: process.env.TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD!,
    tenantId: process.env.TEAMS_APP_TENANT_ID!,
  },
  limit: 25,
  teamId: "19:team@thread.tacv2",
});

const latestText = messages.items[0]?.text;
```

Graph reads require the same Microsoft Graph permissions as the full adapter. Channel and group-chat reads can use RSC permissions; DM reads require Azure AD application permissions such as `Chat.Read.All`.

### Formatting

Teams renders message text as HTML. The format subpath provides small helpers for custom runtimes:

```typescript
import {
  formatTeamsMention,
  markdownToTeamsHtml,
  teamsHtmlToMarkdown,
} from "@chat-adapter/teams/format";

const html = markdownToTeamsHtml(
  `${formatTeamsMention("Ada")} approved **deploy v2.4.1**`
);
const markdown = teamsHtmlToMarkdown("<p>Hello <strong>world</strong></p>");
```

Use the full `TeamsFormatConverter` from `@chat-adapter/teams` when you need mdast conversion inside Chat SDK.

### Cards

The cards subpath converts simple card objects into Adaptive Card JSON without importing the full `chat` JSX runtime.

```typescript title="cards.ts" lineNumbers
import {
  cardToAdaptiveCard,
  cardToTeamsFallbackText,
} from "@chat-adapter/teams/cards";
import { postTeamsMessage } from "@chat-adapter/teams/api";

const card = {
  children: [
    { content: "deploy v2.4.1?", type: "text" },
    {
      children: [
        { id: "approve", label: "Approve", style: "primary", type: "button" },
        { id: "deny", label: "Deny", style: "danger", type: "button" },
      ],
      type: "actions",
    },
  ],
  title: "Deployment",
  type: "card",
} as const;

await postTeamsMessage({
  adaptiveCard: cardToAdaptiveCard(card),
  conversationId: payload.continuation.conversationId,
  credentials,
  serviceUrl: payload.continuation.serviceUrl,
  text: cardToTeamsFallbackText(card),
});
```

Use the full Chat SDK card JSX when you want cross-platform rendering. Use `@chat-adapter/teams/cards` when you are building a Teams-only runtime and want Adaptive Card output directly.

### Modals

Teams Task Modules are invoke-based dialogs backed by Adaptive Cards. The modals subpath builds those cards and parses submit data.

```typescript
import {
  modalToAdaptiveCard,
  parseTeamsDialogSubmitValues,
  toTeamsTaskModuleResponse,
} from "@chat-adapter/teams/modals";

const modal = {
  callbackId: "deploy",
  children: [
    { content: "Why deploy now?", type: "text" },
    { id: "reason", label: "Reason", type: "text_input" },
  ],
  title: "Deploy",
  type: "modal",
} as const;

const card = modalToAdaptiveCard(modal, { contextId: "deploy-1" });
const values = parseTeamsDialogSubmitValues(payload.value);

return Response.json(
  toTeamsTaskModuleResponse({ action: "update", modal }, { contextId: "deploy-1" })
);
```

### Import boundaries

The low-level Teams subpaths are designed to avoid the full runtime import graph:

* no `chat` import
* no `@chat-adapter/shared` import
* no `@microsoft/teams.apps` import
* no full adapter import

The package still installs the full Teams adapter dependencies. The subpaths keep your source and bundle imports clean, but they are not a package-size split.
