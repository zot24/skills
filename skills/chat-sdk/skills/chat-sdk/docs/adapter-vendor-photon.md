# Photon


## Install


For production, use a persistent state adapter such as `@chat-adapter/state-redis` instead of in-memory state.

## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";
import { createiMessageAdapter } from "@photon-ai/chat-adapter-imessage";

export const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  state: createMemoryState(),
  adapters: {
    imessage: createiMessageAdapter({
      local: false,
      projectId: process.env.IMESSAGE_PROJECT_ID,
      projectSecret: process.env.IMESSAGE_PROJECT_SECRET,
    }),
  },
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});
```

For local development on a Mac, drop the credentials and use local mode:

```typescript
createiMessageAdapter({ local: true });
```

Local mode requires macOS with iMessage signed in and **Full Disk Access** granted to your terminal or app (**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access**).

## Platform setup

The adapter is built on [spectrum-ts](https://github.com/photon-hq/spectrum-ts), Photon's unified messaging SDK, and runs in three modes. It detects the mode from environment variables.

### Cloud (recommended)

Cloud mode connects to [Spectrum Cloud](https://app.photon.codes) with a project ID and secret, and runs anywhere, including serverless.

1. Sign up at [app.photon.codes](https://app.photon.codes) to get your project ID and project secret.
2. Set `IMESSAGE_PROJECT_ID`, `IMESSAGE_PROJECT_SECRET`, and `IMESSAGE_LOCAL=false`.

### Self-hosted

Self-hosted mode connects to your own `@photon-ai/advanced-imessage` gRPC endpoint.

1. Set `IMESSAGE_SERVER_URL` to the server's gRPC address as `host:port` (for example, `imessage.example.com:443`). Don't use an `https://` URL.
2. Set `IMESSAGE_API_KEY` to the server's auth token, and `IMESSAGE_LOCAL=false`.

### Local

Local mode runs directly on a Mac and reads the on-device iMessage database. It is macOS only.

1. Grant **Full Disk Access** to your terminal or app.
2. Make sure iMessage is signed in and working on the Mac. Local mode is the default, so no extra environment variables are required.

## Configuration


### Environment variables

| Variable                  | Required  | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IMESSAGE_LOCAL`          | No        | `"false"` for cloud/self-host; local mode is the default.           |
| `IMESSAGE_PROJECT_ID`     | Cloud     | Spectrum Cloud project ID.                                          |
| `IMESSAGE_PROJECT_SECRET` | Cloud     | Spectrum Cloud project secret.                                      |
| `IMESSAGE_SERVER_URL`     | Self-host | gRPC `host:port` of your iMessage server (not an https URL).        |
| `IMESSAGE_API_KEY`        | Self-host | Auth token for the self-hosted server.                              |
| `IMESSAGE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhooks  | Per-webhook signing secret for verifying Spectrum Cloud deliveries. |
| `IMESSAGE_PHONE`          | No        | Routing/identity phone for multi-number setups.                     |

## Receiving messages

The adapter maps an iMessage chat to a Chat SDK thread, a text to a message, and a tapback to a reaction, so subscriptions, handlers, posts, and reactions work the same as with any other adapter.

In remote (cloud) mode, you can receive inbound messages in two ways:

* Webhooks, recommended for serverless: Spectrum Cloud delivers each message to an HTTPS endpoint as signed JSON, with no long-lived connection or cron job.
* Gateway listener: `startGatewayListener()` consumes the spectrum-ts message stream in real time. It works in all modes, but in serverless it needs a cron job to stay connected.

### Webhooks

Register your endpoint URL in the [Spectrum Cloud dashboard](https://app.photon.codes) and copy the per-webhook signing secret, which is shown only once, into `IMESSAGE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. The adapter verifies the `X-Spectrum-Signature` HMAC on every delivery and rejects unsigned, mismatched, or stale requests older than 5 minutes.

```typescript title="app/api/imessage/webhook/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  return bot.webhooks.imessage(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

`bot.webhooks.imessage` verifies the signature, parses the `messages` event, and routes the message into your bot. Processing runs in the background through `waitUntil`, so the endpoint acknowledges immediately. Spectrum Cloud retries failed deliveries and delivers at least once, so dedupe on `X-Spectrum-Webhook-Id` plus `message.id` if you need exactly-once side effects.

A webhook delivery carries no live connection, but your bot can still respond. For a DM, the adapter rebuilds the thread from its address over spectrum-ts (gRPC) and can send, react, edit, and show typing without the gateway:

```typescript
bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post("Got it!"); // works directly from a webhook delivery (DM)
});
```

Replying into a group requires that the group was received over the gateway listener in the same session, because an unseen group cannot be reconstructed from its id. See [Limitations](#limitations).

### Gateway listener for serverless

Drive `startGatewayListener()` from an authenticated cron route so the stream stays connected:

```typescript title="app/api/imessage/gateway/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export const maxDuration = 800;

export async function GET(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;
  if (!cronSecret) {
    return new Response("CRON_SECRET not configured", { status: 500 });
  }
  if (request.headers.get("authorization") !== `Bearer ${cronSecret}`) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }

  const durationMs = 600 * 1000;
  return bot.adapters.imessage.startGatewayListener(
    { waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task) },
    durationMs
  );
}
```

```json title="vercel.json"
{
  "crons": [{ "path": "/api/imessage/gateway", "schedule": "*/9 * * * *" }]
}
```

Running every 9 minutes overlaps the 10-minute listener duration. `CRON_SECRET` is added automatically by Vercel when you configure cron jobs.

## Message format

iMessage is plain text only. Outbound markdown is rendered to plain text, which strips the formatting but keeps the content. Inbound text is parsed into the Chat SDK AST.

## Reactions

iMessage uses tapbacks instead of emoji reactions. The adapter maps standard emoji names to tapbacks when adding a reaction (remote mode only):

| Emoji name                  | Tapback   |
| --------------------------- | --------- |
| `love` / `heart`            | Love      |
| `like` / `thumbs_up`        | Like      |
| `dislike` / `thumbs_down`   | Dislike   |
| `laugh`                     | Laugh     |
| `emphasize` / `exclamation` | Emphasize |
| `question`                  | Question  |

Removing reactions is not supported.

## Attachments

The adapter supports file uploads for sending. Files attached to a post are delivered as iMessage media:

```typescript
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

await thread.post({
  markdown: "Here is the receipt.",
  files: [
    {
      filename: "receipt.pdf",
      mimeType: "application/pdf",
      data: await readFile("receipt.pdf"),
    },
  ],
});
```

## Modals

Modal support is limited. Remote mode maps the Chat SDK's `openModal()` to iMessage native polls. Only the first `Select` in the modal is used: `Modal.title` becomes the poll question and `Select.options` (2 to 10) become the choices. Votes fire `onModalSubmit` with the selected option's `value`.

```typescript
bot.onModalSubmit("fav-color", async (event) => {
  const color = event.values.color; // e.g. "red"
});
```

Not supported: `TextInput`, `RadioSelect`, placeholders, submit/close labels, more than one `Select`, and vote deselection. Polls in the same chat must have distinct titles. Local mode throws `NotImplementedError`.

## Limitations

* DMs can be sent cold, but groups are session-bound. A DM thread is rebuilt from its address over gRPC, so the adapter can send, react, edit, and show typing even into a thread it has not seen this session, including from a webhook. A group chat has no by-id resolver, so addressing one requires it to have been received over the gateway or stream in the current session. Cold sends to an unseen group throw `NotImplementedError`.
* spectrum-ts doesn't support message history or thread info, so `fetchMessages` and `fetchThread` are unavailable.
* `removeReaction` is not supported.
* Reactions, typing, editing, and modals require cloud or self-host mode. Local mode supports sending and receiving only.
* iMessage has no markdown or structured cards.
* Local mode requires macOS. Cloud and self-host run anywhere.
