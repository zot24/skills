# Kapso


## Install


The examples below use `@chat-adapter/state-memory` for local development. Install a durable Chat SDK state adapter for production.

## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";
import { createKapsoAdapter } from "@kapso/chat-adapter";

export const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "support",
  state: createMemoryState(),
  adapters: {
    kapso: createKapsoAdapter({
      kapsoApiKey: process.env.KAPSO_API_KEY,
      phoneNumberId: process.env.KAPSO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID,
      webhookSecret: process.env.KAPSO_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
    }),
  },
});

bot.onDirectMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});
```

Kapso webhooks are direct-message conversations, which is why the example uses `onDirectMessage`. Replies, cards, files, reactions, and history calls use the same Chat SDK `Thread` and `Message` APIs as the official adapters.

## Platform setup

1. Create or use a Kapso integration and copy your **API key**.
2. Copy the WhatsApp **phone number ID** connected in Kapso if the bot will initiate outbound direct messages.
3. Create a webhook secret in Kapso and set the same value as `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
4. Set your webhook endpoint URL to the public route that forwards requests to `bot.webhooks.kapso`.
5. Subscribe to `whatsapp.message.received`; add `whatsapp.message.sent` only if your app needs sent-message echoes.

## Configuration


### Environment variables

| Variable                | Required    | Description                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `KAPSO_API_KEY`         | Yes         | Kapso API key used for sends, history, contacts, conversations, and media.                             |
| `KAPSO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | Recommended | WhatsApp phone number ID connected in Kapso. Required for `openDM()` and useful as a webhook fallback. |
| `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`  | Recommended | Secret used to verify Kapso `X-Webhook-Signature` webhook deliveries.                                  |
| `KAPSO_BASE_URL`        | No          | Kapso proxy URL. Defaults to `https://api.kapso.ai/meta/whatsapp`.                                     |
| `KAPSO_BOT_USERNAME`    | No          | Bot display name. Defaults to the Chat SDK `userName` after initialization.                            |

## Webhooks

Kapso sends platform webhooks as `POST` requests. Forward the raw `Request` to Chat SDK:

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/kapso/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  return bot.webhooks.kapso(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

By default, the adapter verifies the Kapso `X-Webhook-Signature` header and returns `401` when a signature is invalid. Pass `verifyWebhookSignatures: false` only for unsigned local fixtures.

## Sending messages

Reply inside an incoming WhatsApp handler:

```typescript
bot.onDirectMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post({
    markdown: `Received: **${message.text}**`,
  });
});
```

Start a WhatsApp conversation from your app with `openDM()`:

```typescript
import type { KapsoAdapter } from "@kapso/chat-adapter";

const adapter = bot.getAdapter("kapso") as KapsoAdapter;
const threadId = await adapter.openDM("15551234567");
const thread = bot.thread(threadId);

await thread.post("Hello from Kapso.");
```

## Buttons and cards

Chat SDK card buttons render as WhatsApp reply buttons.

```tsx
import { Actions, Button, Card } from "chat";

await thread.post(
  Card({
    title: "Approve refund?",
    children: [
      Actions([
        Button({ id: "approve", label: "Approve", value: "refund-123" }),
        Button({ id: "reject", label: "Reject", value: "refund-123" }),
      ]),
    ],
  })
);
```

WhatsApp allows up to 3 reply buttons, and each label must be 1-20 characters. If a card breaks either limit, the adapter throws a validation error rather than truncating labels or dropping buttons.

## Media

Send files through Chat SDK:

```typescript
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

await thread.post({
  markdown: "Here is the receipt.",
  files: [
    {
      filename: "receipt.pdf",
      mimeType: "application/pdf",
      data: await readFile("receipt.pdf"),
    },
  ],
});
```

Inbound media arrives as Chat SDK attachments. When Kapso includes a mirrored media URL, the attachment has a `url`. When a WhatsApp media ID is available, the attachment has a lazy `fetchData()`.

## History

When `KAPSO_API_KEY` is set, `fetchMessages()` reads history from Kapso:

```typescript
const page = await thread.adapter.fetchMessages(thread.id, { limit: 20 });
```

`fetchThread()` enriches metadata with Kapso contact and conversation records when available.

## Thread IDs

Current thread IDs use this format, where the conversation ID segment is optional:

```text
kapso:<base64url(phoneNumberId)>:<base64url(waId)>[:<base64url(conversationId)>]
```

Use the adapter's helpers rather than building thread IDs by hand:

```typescript
const threadId = adapter.encodeThreadId({
  phoneNumberId: "16315558151",
  waId: "15551234567",
});

const decoded = adapter.decodeThreadId(threadId);
```

## Limitations

* Direct Meta webhook setup is a compatibility path. Prefer Kapso platform webhooks.
* WhatsApp and Kapso don't support editing or deleting messages on recipient devices.
* WhatsApp and Kapso don't support streaming to recipient devices.
* Send raw WhatsApp templates, flows, and catalogs through `@kapso/whatsapp-cloud-api` directly, alongside the Chat SDK adapter.
