# Google Chat


## Install


## Quick start


  The adapter auto-detects `GOOGLE_CHAT_CREDENTIALS` (or `GOOGLE_CHAT_USE_ADC`) from the environment.


```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createGoogleChatAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/gchat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    gchat: createGoogleChatAdapter(),
  },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post("Hello from Google Chat!");
});
```

The memory state adapter keeps subscriptions and locks in process memory, which suits local development. Use [Redis](/adapters/official/redis) or [PostgreSQL](/adapters/official/postgres) in production.

## Platform setup

### 1. Create a GCP project

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a project.
2. Enable **Google Chat API**, **Google Workspace Events API** (for receiving all messages), and **Cloud Pub/Sub API**.

### 2. Create a service account

1. Open **IAM & Admin** then **Service Accounts** and click **Create Service Account**.
2. After creation, open the account and go to the **Keys** tab.
3. Click **Add Key** then **Create new key** then **JSON**.
4. Copy the JSON to `GOOGLE_CHAT_CREDENTIALS`.


  If your organization has the `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` constraint enabled, you need to relax it or add a project exception under **IAM & Admin** then **Organization Policies**.


### 3. Configure the Chat app

1. Open the [Chat API configuration](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/chat.googleapis.com/hangouts-chat).
2. Fill in the app name, avatar, and description.
3. Enable **Receive 1:1 messages** and **Join spaces and group conversations**.
4. Set connection settings to **App URL** with `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/gchat`.
5. Set visibility, then save.

### 4. Add the bot to a space

1. Open Google Chat.
2. In a Space, open **Manage apps & integrations** then **Add apps** and find your app.

## Configuration


One of `googleChatProjectNumber`, `endpointUrl`, `pubsubAudience`, or `disableSignatureVerification: true` is required, and the constructor throws otherwise. Configure a verifier for each transport you actually receive.

Set `botUserId` (or `GOOGLE_CHAT_BOT_USER_ID`) to the canonical `sender.name` from a verified message authored by your Chat app, such as `users/123456789`. The adapter never learns this identity from inbound mentions. When it is omitted, all `BOT` senders are conservatively treated as self to prevent reply loops.

Apps upgrading from an earlier release that rely on mention handlers must configure `botUserId` to preserve mention handling. Without it, bot mention annotations are left unchanged and the default `onNewMention` detection may no longer match them.

`endpointUrl` has no environment variable; pass it in config.

## Webhook verification

Direct webhooks and Pub/Sub pushes share one HTTP endpoint, so each verifier covers only its own request shape:

* Direct webhooks: Google Chat sends a signed JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer …` header. The expected `aud` claim depends on how the Chat app is configured (see [Verify requests from Google Chat](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/verify-requests-from-chat)).
* Pub/Sub push: Cloud Pub/Sub sends a signed OIDC JWT whose audience is whatever you configured on the push subscription. Configure both `pubsubAudience` and `pubsubServiceAccountEmail`.


  Your push audience is a public URL, so anyone can point a Pub/Sub subscription in their own Google Cloud project at your endpoint and have Google mint a validly signed token naming it. Signature and `aud` therefore say nothing about who sent the push. Set `pubsubServiceAccountEmail` to the identity in your subscription's push auth settings and the adapter compares it exactly, as [Google requires](https://docs.cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/authenticate-push-subscriptions). Leave it unset and Pub/Sub pushes are rejected with HTTP 401.


If you configure only a direct-webhook verifier, incoming Pub/Sub-shaped requests are rejected with HTTP 401, and the reverse is also true. Configure both transports if you receive both.

### Which direct-webhook option do I need?

| Your Chat app                                                                                     | Token type & `aud`                         | Signed by                                                                               | Set                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Standalone Chat app, **Authentication audience: Project number** (in Chat API config)             | self-signed JWT, `aud` = project number    | `chat@system.gserviceaccount.com` (its own X.509 certs)                                 | `googleChatProjectNumber`                             |
| Standalone Chat app, **Authentication audience: HTTP endpoint URL**                               | Google OIDC ID token, `aud` = endpoint URL | Google (`email`: `chat@system.gserviceaccount.com`)                                     | `endpointUrl`                                         |
| Workspace Add-on Chat app (built via Google Workspace Marketplace SDK; the audience is hardcoded) | Google OIDC ID token, `aud` = endpoint URL | Google (`email`: `service-{projectNumber}@gcp-sa-gsuiteaddons.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) | `endpointUrl` and `workspaceAddOnServiceAccountEmail` |
| Mixed across envs / not sure                                                                      | varies                                     | varies                                                                                  | both `googleChatProjectNumber` and `endpointUrl`      |

The two token types are verified differently, matching [Google's reference implementation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/verify-requests-from-chat): endpoint-URL tokens are standard OIDC ID tokens checked against Google's public certs plus the Chat service-account `email` claim; project-number tokens are self-signed by `chat@system.gserviceaccount.com` and checked against that service account's own X.509 certificates. When both `googleChatProjectNumber` and `endpointUrl` are set, either token type is accepted. If you don't know which mode your app uses, look at an incoming token: an `email` claim containing `gcp-sa-gsuiteaddons` means it's a Workspace Add-on (URL audience).


  Every Workspace Add-on project produces an `email` of the same `service-{projectNumber}@gcp-sa-gsuiteaddons` shape, so that shape identifies some add-on, not necessarily yours. Set `workspaceAddOnServiceAccountEmail` to your own project's address and the adapter compares it exactly. Leave it unset and add-on tokens are rejected with HTTP 401, rather than accepting any add-on that happens to point at your endpoint URL. Standalone Chat apps signing as `chat@system.gserviceaccount.com` are unaffected.


  Workspace Add-on Chat apps don't expose an "Authentication audience" radio; their token `aud` is always the endpoint URL. Set `endpointUrl` for these.


## Pub/Sub for receiving all messages

By default, Google Chat sends webhooks only for @mentions. To receive all messages in a space, set up Workspace Events with Pub/Sub.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
createGoogleChatAdapter({
  pubsubTopic: process.env.GOOGLE_CHAT_PUBSUB_TOPIC,
  impersonateUser: process.env.GOOGLE_CHAT_IMPERSONATE_USER,
});
```

### Topic and subscription

1. Under **Pub/Sub** then **Topics**, create a topic (for example, `chat-events`) and copy its full name to `GOOGLE_CHAT_PUBSUB_TOPIC`.
2. Add `chat-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com` as a Pub/Sub Publisher.
3. Create a Push subscription with endpoint `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/gchat`. Enable authentication on it and pick a service account, then set that account's email as `GOOGLE_CHAT_PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`.

### Domain-wide delegation

Domain-wide delegation is required for Workspace Events subscriptions and for initiating DMs.

1. In **IAM & Admin** then **Service Accounts**, edit your service account and check **Enable Google Workspace Domain-wide Delegation**. Copy the numeric **Client ID**.
2. In the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com), go to **Security** then **Access and data control** then **API controls**, then **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
3. Add the Client ID with these comma-separated scopes:
   ```
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly,
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.readonly,
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces,
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.create
   ```
4. Set `GOOGLE_CHAT_IMPERSONATE_USER` to an admin email.

## Limitations

* Typing indicators are not supported by the Google Chat API.
* Adding reactions: the Chat API doesn't allow service-account auth for reactions. With `impersonateUser` configured, the reaction appears as coming from the impersonated user.
* Message history (`fetchMessages`) requires domain-wide delegation with `impersonateUser`.
