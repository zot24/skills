# Mattermost


## Install

<PackageInstall package="chat-adapter-mattermost chat" />

Requires Node.js 20+ and a Mattermost server with a bot account.

## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers


const adapter = createMattermostAdapter({
  baseUrl: process.env.MATTERMOST_BASE_URL,
  botToken: process.env.MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN,
});

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "my-bot",
  adapters: {
    mattermost: adapter,
  },
});

await bot.initialize();

bot.onNewMention(async (thread) => {
  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post("Hello from Mattermost via Chat SDK.");
});
```

Configuration can also be provided through environment variables:

```bash
export MATTERMOST_BASE_URL=https://mattermost.example.com
export MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
```

```typescript
const adapter = createMattermostAdapter();
```

## Mattermost setup

1. **Create a bot account.** In Mattermost go to **System Console → Integrations → Bot Accounts** and create a new bot. Copy the generated access token.
2. **Enable integrations.** Ensure your Mattermost server allows bot accounts and has the REST API + WebSocket gateway accessible (both are enabled by default).
3. **Add the bot to channels.** Add the bot user to any channels where it should respond — it only receives events from channels it is a member of.
4. **Interactive actions (optional).** To use buttons and selects, set `callbackUrl` to a public URL that Mattermost can reach. The adapter exposes `handleWebhook()` for this:

   ```typescript
   adapter.handleWebhook(request);
   ```

   Register this URL in **System Console → Integrations → Interactive Dialogs** or per-post via the `integration` field.

## Notes

* Connects to Mattermost over the REST API v4 and the `/api/v4/websocket` gateway.
* Thread IDs are encoded as `mattermost:<channel>` for channel-level contexts or `mattermost:<channel>:<rootPostId>` for threaded replies.
* User and channel data are cached in-memory with LRU eviction (up to 1000 entries each).
* WebSocket reconnection uses exponential backoff with jitter (1 s base, 30 s max).
* The `@chat-adapter/*` npm scope is reserved for official adapters; this package is published as `chat-adapter-mattermost`.

## Limitations

* **Modals** — no modal open or submit flows.
* **Slash commands** — no slash-command parsing or dispatch.
* **Interactive actions** — interactive button and select callbacks are received, but the full action lifecycle is not complete.
* **File uploads on edit** — sending and receiving file attachments works, but editing a message with new uploads is not supported.
* **Streaming** — falls back to the post+edit pattern; Mattermost has no native streaming transport.
* **Rate-limit handling** — auth, permission, not-found, and network failures are mapped, but rate-limit responses are not yet surfaced as a typed error.
