# Mattermost


## Install


## Quick start

The adapter requires Node.js 20+ and a Mattermost server with a bot account. It's published as `chat-adapter-mattermost` because the `@chat-adapter/*` npm scope is reserved for official adapters.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMattermostAdapter } from "chat-adapter-mattermost";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";

const adapter = createMattermostAdapter({
  baseUrl: process.env.MATTERMOST_BASE_URL,
  botToken: process.env.MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN,
});

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "my-bot",
  adapters: {
    mattermost: adapter,
  },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

await bot.initialize();

bot.onNewMention(async (thread) => {
  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post("Hello from Mattermost via Chat SDK.");
});
```

The memory state adapter keeps subscriptions and locks in process memory, which suits local development. Use [Redis](/adapters/official/redis) or [PostgreSQL](/adapters/official/postgres) in production.

## Platform setup

1. Create a bot account. In Mattermost, go to **System Console → Integrations → Bot Accounts**, create a new bot, and copy the generated access token.
2. Enable integrations. Make sure your Mattermost server allows bot accounts and that the REST API and WebSocket gateway are reachable. Both are enabled by default.
3. Add the bot user to every channel where it should respond. It only receives events from channels it is a member of.
4. Optionally, set up interactive actions. To use buttons and selects, set `callbackUrl` to a public URL that Mattermost can reach. The adapter exposes `handleWebhook()` for this:

   ```typescript
   adapter.handleWebhook(request);
   ```

   Register this URL in **System Console → Integrations → Interactive Dialogs** or per post via the `integration` field.

## Configuration

Instead of passing `baseUrl` and `botToken`, you can provide the configuration through environment variables:

```bash
export MATTERMOST_BASE_URL=https://mattermost.example.com
export MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
```

```typescript
const adapter = createMattermostAdapter();
```

### Environment variables

| Variable               | Required                        | Description               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `MATTERMOST_BASE_URL`  | Yes, unless you pass `baseUrl`  | Mattermost server URL.    |
| `MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes, unless you pass `botToken` | Bot account access token. |

## Transport

The adapter connects to Mattermost over the REST API v4 and the `/api/v4/websocket` gateway. WebSocket reconnection uses exponential backoff with jitter (1 s base, 30 s max).

## Thread IDs

Thread IDs are encoded as `mattermost:<channel>` for channel-level contexts or `mattermost:<channel>:<rootPostId>` for threaded replies.

## Limitations

* No modal open or submit flows.
* No slash-command parsing or dispatch.
* Interactive button and select callbacks are received, but the full action lifecycle is not complete.
* Sending and receiving file attachments works, but editing a message with new uploads is not supported.
* Streaming falls back to the post+edit pattern, because Mattermost has no native streaming transport.
* Auth, permission, not-found, and network failures are mapped to errors, but rate-limit responses are not yet surfaced as a typed error.
* User and channel data are cached in memory with LRU eviction (up to 1000 entries each).
