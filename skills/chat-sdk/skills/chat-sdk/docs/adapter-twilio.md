# Twilio


## Install


## Quick start


  The adapter auto-detects `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, and `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID` from the environment.


```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { createTwilioAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/twilio";
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    twilio: createTwilioAdapter(),
  },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

bot.onDirectMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});
```

The memory state adapter keeps subscriptions and locks in process memory, which suits local development. Use [Redis](/adapters/official/redis) or [PostgreSQL](/adapters/official/postgres) in production.

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/twilio/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  return bot.webhooks.twilio(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

## Platform setup

### 1. Get credentials

1. Create or open a Twilio account.
2. Copy the **Account SID** to `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`.
3. Copy the **Auth Token** to `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`.
4. Copy a sender phone number to `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, or copy a Messaging Service SID to `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID`.

### 2. Configure the Messaging webhook

Set your Twilio Messaging webhook URL to:

```text
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/twilio
```

### 3. Set up RCS (optional)

RCS uses the same webhook URL and adapter as SMS and MMS, so it needs no separate endpoint. To enable RCS rich messaging:

1. Register an RCS Sender in the Twilio Console under **Messaging** then **RCS Senders**. Carrier approval typically takes 4 to 6 weeks.
2. Add the RCS Sender and an SMS phone number to a Messaging Service so Twilio can fall back to SMS when RCS is unavailable.
3. Set `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID` to the Messaging Service SID, which starts with `MG`.
4. Point the Messaging Service webhook to the same URL as your SMS webhook. The adapter handles both channels.

See [RCS](#rcs) for how the adapter behaves once RCS is enabled.

## Configuration


### Environment variables

| Variable                       | Required            | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`           | Yes                 | Twilio Account SID                                                                                                                  |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`            | Yes                 | Auth Token for API calls and webhook signature verification                                                                         |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`          | For `openDM`        | Default sender phone number. `openDM` uses the first of this, `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID`, or `TWILIO_RCS_SENDER_ID` that is set |
| `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID` | For `openDM` or RCS | Default Messaging Service SID. Required for RCS                                                                                     |
| `TWILIO_RCS_SENDER_ID`         | No                  | Direct RCS sender address for `openDM`, such as `rcs:MyBrand`                                                                       |

## Webhooks

Twilio sends Messaging webhooks as form-encoded requests and signs them with the `X-Twilio-Signature` header. The adapter validates the exact public URL plus the submitted form parameters before dispatching an inbound message.

If your framework rewrites the request URL before it reaches the adapter, pass `webhookUrl` with the public URL configured in Twilio:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
createTwilioAdapter({
  webhookUrl: "https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/twilio",
});
```

## RCS

When the sender is RCS-capable (an `MG…` Messaging Service or an `rcs:` address), the adapter:

* Sends cards as Twilio Content API templates (rich cards with buttons) over RCS.
* Includes an SMS text fallback in every template so non-RCS recipients get a usable message.
* Routes inbound taps of buttons rendered by Chat SDK to `onAction` handlers.

Inbound RCS messages are keyed to the Messaging Service (or configured RCS sender), so replies go back out over RCS. Plain SMS threads keep their phone-number thread IDs even when the number belongs to a Messaging Service, and `openDM` prefers `phoneNumber` over `messagingServiceSid` and `rcsSenderId`, so enabling RCS does not change the thread IDs of existing conversations.

Button taps from templates that Chat SDK did not send (for example Studio flows or pre-created WhatsApp templates) are not turned into actions. When they carry a message body, they arrive as regular messages, matching the adapter's behavior before RCS support.

Content templates are created on demand and reused by a stable name derived from the card's content, so identical cards share one template across restarts. Cards that embed changing values (timestamps, order IDs, user names) produce a new template per unique body, and Twilio keeps Content resources until you delete them. For high-volume use, keep card bodies stable or pre-create templates.

### Sending rich cards

```typescript title="send-card.ts" lineNumbers
import { Actions, Button, Card, CardText } from "chat";

await thread.post({
  card: Card({
    title: "Deploy v1.2.3",
    children: [
      CardText("Ready to deploy to production?"),
      Actions([
        Button({ id: "approve", label: "Approve", value: "v1.2.3" }),
        Button({ id: "reject", label: "Reject" }),
      ]),
    ],
  }),
});
```

Over RCS, this renders as a rich card with tappable buttons. Over SMS, it falls back to plain text.

### Handling button taps

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onAction(async (action) => {
  if (action.actionId === "approve") {
    await action.thread.post(`Approved: ${action.value}`);
  }
});
```

## Media

Inbound MMS media is exposed as message attachments. Twilio media URLs are not treated as public files, so each attachment includes `fetchData()` and `fetchMetadata` for authenticated downloads and queue rehydration.

Outbound media supports attachments that already have a public `url`. Chat SDK cannot upload arbitrary binary files to Twilio for you because the Messages API expects each `MediaUrl` to be reachable by Twilio.

```typescript title="send-photo.ts" lineNumbers
await thread.post({
  markdown: "photo attached",
  attachments: [
    {
      type: "image",
      url: "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
    },
  ],
});
```

## Messaging services

When a thread sender starts with `MG`, outbound messages use `MessagingServiceSid` instead of `From`:

```typescript title="send-with-service.ts" lineNumbers
const threadId = twilio.encodeThreadId({
  sender: "MGXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  recipient: "+15555550100",
});

await bot.adapters.twilio.postMessage(threadId, "hello");
```

## Low-level helpers

The package includes runtime-light subpaths for apps that only need Twilio primitives:

```typescript title="twilio-primitives.ts" lineNumbers
import { sendTwilioMessage } from "@chat-adapter/twilio/api";
import { truncateTwilioText } from "@chat-adapter/twilio/format";
import { gatherSpeechTwilioResponse } from "@chat-adapter/twilio/voice";
import { readTwilioWebhook } from "@chat-adapter/twilio/webhook";
```

These subpaths do not import the full Chat SDK adapter or the `twilio` npm package.

## Voice helpers

The SMS/MMS adapter does not route Twilio voice calls. Instead, the package exposes voice primitives for apps that own their voice route and want reusable TwiML or call-update helpers:

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/twilio/voice/route.ts" lineNumbers
import {
  gatherSpeechTwilioResponse,
  parseTwilioVoiceCall,
} from "@chat-adapter/twilio/voice";
import { verifyTwilioRequest } from "@chat-adapter/twilio/webhook";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const verified = await verifyTwilioRequest(request);
  const call = parseTwilioVoiceCall(verified.params);

  if (!call) {
    return new Response("Invalid voice webhook", { status: 400 });
  }

  return gatherSpeechTwilioResponse({
    actionUrl: "https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/twilio/voice/result",
    prompt: "How can I help?",
  });
}
```

Custom voice routes should verify the Twilio signature and apply your own caller allow-list before returning TwiML.

For live calls, `updateTwilioCall()` in `@chat-adapter/twilio/api` can post replacement TwiML or redirect the call to another URL.

## Thread IDs

```
twilio:{sender}:{recipient}
```

Example: `twilio:%2B15555550123:%2B15555550100`.

`sender` is the bot's phone number, Messaging Service SID (`MG…`), or RCS sender address, and `recipient` is the user's address. Both segments are URI-encoded.

## Limitations

* Twilio does not support message edits, reactions, modals, or typing indicators for SMS.
* Cards render as rich RCS content only when the sender is a Messaging Service (`MG…`) or RCS address; otherwise they fall back to plain text.
* RCS read receipts (`EventType=READ`) are parsed and logged but not surfaced to Chat SDK handlers, because no delivery API exists today.
* `fetchMessages` uses the Messages API and is best for phone-number based threads. Messaging Service history can be less precise because inbound webhooks identify the receiving phone number, not only the Messaging Service SID.
