# Conversation History


Bots that hold context across a user's conversations need somewhere to store it. The platform's own message history won't do — a user might talk to your bot in Slack today and Discord tomorrow, and you want the same memory to follow them.

`bot.transcripts` keeps a per-user transcript in your state adapter, keyed by a stable identifier you choose (an email, an internal user ID, anything that's the same person no matter where they are).

## Setup

You opt in by setting two fields on `ChatConfig`:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createSlackAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/slack";
import { createDiscordAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/discord";
import { createRedisState } from "@chat-adapter/state-redis";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    slack: createSlackAdapter(),
    discord: createDiscordAdapter(),
  },
  state: createRedisState({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL! }),

  // Resolve the cross-platform identifier for an inbound message.
  // Return null for messages you don't want to remember.
  identity: ({ author }) => author.email ?? null,

  // Storage tuning. retention is the list TTL, refreshed on every append.
  transcripts: {
    retention: "30d",
    maxPerUser: 200,
  },
});
```

`transcripts` and `identity` are paired — set one without the other and the constructor throws. This keeps the API loud rather than silently no-op'ing on every call.

## Building LLM context

The most common pattern: append the user's message, build a prompt from recent transcript entries, post the reply, append the reply too.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, msg) => {
  await bot.transcripts.append(thread, msg);

  const recent = await bot.transcripts.list({
    userKey: msg.userKey!,
    limit: 20,
  });

  const reply = await generateReply(recent, msg);
  await thread.post(reply);

  await bot.transcripts.append(
    thread,
    { role: "assistant", text: reply },
    { userKey: msg.userKey! }
  );
});
```

A few things worth knowing:

* **`msg.userKey`** is set automatically from your `identity` resolver before your handler runs. If the resolver returned `null`, it stays `undefined` and the `append` call no-ops.
* **Bot replies are explicit.** The SDK doesn't auto-capture `thread.post()` output — you decide what gets remembered. That's important for retries, intermediate streaming chunks, and anything you don't want feeding back into the model later.
* **Order is chronological.** `list` returns oldest-first, ready to feed into a model. Set `limit` to keep prompts bounded.

## Identity resolution

`identity` runs once per inbound message during dispatch. The `author`, `message`, and `adapter` name are all available:

```typescript
identity: async ({ adapter, author, message }) => {
  // Look up by email when the platform exposes it
  if (author.email) {
    return author.email;
  }
  // Or map a platform user to an internal ID
  return await lookupUser(adapter, author.userId);
}
```

Return `null` when you can't resolve a key. The SDK won't fall back to a platform-specific ID — that would silently fragment a user's transcript across platforms, which is exactly what this feature is here to prevent.

If your resolver throws, the SDK logs a warning and dispatches the message without a `userKey`. Handlers still run; only the persistence is skipped.

## Filtering entries

`list` accepts a few filters. They compose, and they're applied after `getList` — useful for narrowing prompts without restructuring storage.

```typescript
// Recent N across all platforms
await bot.transcripts.list({ userKey: "mike@acme.com", limit: 50 });

// Single platform
await bot.transcripts.list({ userKey: "mike@acme.com", platforms: ["slack"] });

// Single thread
await bot.transcripts.list({
  userKey: "mike@acme.com",
  threadId: "slack:C123:1234.5678",
});

// Only the user's own messages
await bot.transcripts.list({ userKey: "mike@acme.com", roles: ["user"] });
```

## Deleting a user's transcript

For data-subject requests or simple "forget me" flows:

```typescript
await bot.transcripts.delete({ userKey: "mike@acme.com" });
// → { deleted: 47 }
```

This wipes every entry stored under the key. Single-entry and time-range deletes aren't part of the API — `appendToList` doesn't support them safely under concurrent writes.

## Where it's stored

`bot.transcripts` is backed by `StateAdapter.appendToList` / `getList` / `delete`. Every built-in state adapter (`memory`, `redis`, `ioredis`, `pg`) supports these primitives, so this works on whichever one you've already configured.

Entries are written under the key `transcripts:user:{userKey}` as a capped list. `appendToList` is atomic, so concurrent inbound messages on the same user don't race.
