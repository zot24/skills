# ioredis


## Install


## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createIoRedisState } from "@chat-adapter/state-ioredis";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: { /* ... */ },
  state: createIoRedisState({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL! }),
});
```

## When to choose ioredis vs redis

Both adapters implement the same state operations with the same key layout. The difference is the Redis client underneath.

Use `@chat-adapter/state-ioredis` when:

* You already use ioredis in your project.
* You need Redis Sentinel. Pass a Sentinel-configured `Redis` client as `client`.
* You prefer the ioredis API.

Use [`@chat-adapter/state-redis`](/adapters/official/redis) when:

* You want the official `redis` client.
* You're starting a new project and don't need Sentinel.

Neither adapter supports Redis Cluster. The ioredis adapter's `client` option accepts a `Redis` instance, and an ioredis `Cluster` doesn't satisfy that type.

## Configuration


Either `url` or `client` is required.

### Environment variables

The adapter doesn't read environment variables itself, so pass the URL in your code.

| Variable    | Required | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REDIS_URL` | No       | Redis connection URL. The quick start reads it and passes it as `url`. |

## Using an existing client

Pass an ioredis client as `client`. ioredis connects on its own, and the adapter's `disconnect()` doesn't quit a client it didn't create.

```typescript title="lib/state.ts" lineNumbers
import Redis from "ioredis";
import { createIoRedisState } from "@chat-adapter/state-ioredis";

const client = new Redis("redis://localhost:6379");

export const state = createIoRedisState({ client });
```

## Data model

Every key starts with `keyPrefix`, which defaults to `"chat-sdk"`. The layout matches [`@chat-adapter/state-redis`](/adapters/official/redis#data-model).

| Key                            | Redis type | Contents                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `{keyPrefix}:subscriptions`    | Set        | Subscribed thread IDs                              |
| `{keyPrefix}:lock:{threadId}`  | String     | Lock token, with a TTL                             |
| `{keyPrefix}:cache:{key}`      | String     | JSON-serialized cache value, with an optional TTL  |
| `{keyPrefix}:list:{key}`       | List       | JSON-serialized list entries, with an optional TTL |
| `{keyPrefix}:queue:{threadId}` | List       | Queued messages for a thread, with a TTL           |
