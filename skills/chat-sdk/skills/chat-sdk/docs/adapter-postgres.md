# PostgreSQL


## Install


## Quick start

With no options, `createPostgresState()` connects to the URL in `POSTGRES_URL`, falling back to `DATABASE_URL`.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createPostgresState } from "@chat-adapter/state-pg";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: { /* ... */ },
  state: createPostgresState(),
});
```

By default, the adapter creates its tables and indexes on `connect()` if they don't already exist.

## Configuration


Either `url`, `POSTGRES_URL`/`DATABASE_URL`, or `client` is required.

### Environment variables

| Variable       | Required                                         | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRES_URL` | Unless `url`, `client`, or `DATABASE_URL` is set | Postgres connection URL, used when `url` is not passed.                     |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Unless `url`, `client`, or `POSTGRES_URL` is set | Fallback connection URL, used when neither `url` nor `POSTGRES_URL` is set. |

## Using an existing client

Pass a `pg.Pool` as `client`. The adapter leaves a pool it didn't create open after `disconnect()`.

```typescript title="lib/state.ts" lineNumbers
import pg from "pg";
import { createPostgresState } from "@chat-adapter/state-pg";

const client = new pg.Pool({ connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL! });
export const state = createPostgresState({ client });
```

## Data model

With `autoCreateSchema` left on, the adapter creates these tables on first connect:

```
chat_state_subscriptions
chat_state_locks
chat_state_cache
chat_state_lists
chat_state_queues
```

Every row stores the adapter's `keyPrefix` in its `key_prefix` column, so bots with different prefixes can share the same tables.

## Migration-owned schema

Set `autoCreateSchema: false` when your migrations provision the tables and indexes. The default is `true`.

```typescript
// Explicit URL, or omit url to use POSTGRES_URL / DATABASE_URL.
const state = createPostgresState({
  url: process.env.POSTGRES_URL,
  autoCreateSchema: false,
});
```

An existing pool supports the same option. The adapter has no `schemaName` option: every query uses unqualified table names that resolve through the connection's PostgreSQL `search_path`. To keep the tables in a dedicated schema, set the runtime role's default `search_path`. A role default follows the role through connection poolers such as PgBouncer, Neon, and Supabase in transaction mode, which may reject or silently drop per-connection startup parameters.

```sql
ALTER ROLE chat_runtime SET search_path TO chat_state;
```

On a direct connection you can set it per connection instead, either with `options` on the pool or with `?options=-c%20search_path%3Dchat_state` on the connection URL.

```typescript
import pg from "pg";
import { createPostgresState } from "@chat-adapter/state-pg";

const client = new pg.Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL,
  options: "-c search_path=chat_state",
});
const state = createPostgresState({ client, autoCreateSchema: false });
```

Before starting the bot, run the adapter migration as the schema owner, using the same `search_path` as the runtime connection. Create your chosen schema first if needed. The adapter exports the complete migration as `postgresSchemaStatements`, an ordered array of statements you can run from your own migration tooling:

```typescript
import { postgresSchemaStatements } from "@chat-adapter/state-pg";

for (const statement of postgresSchemaStatements) {
  await client.query(statement);
}
```

If you would rather keep the migration in SQL, these are the same statements. They make up the complete adapter schema; `bigserial` also creates the list and queue sequences.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_subscriptions (
  key_prefix text NOT NULL,
  thread_id text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (key_prefix, thread_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_locks (
  key_prefix text NOT NULL,
  thread_id text NOT NULL,
  token text NOT NULL,
  expires_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (key_prefix, thread_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_cache (
  key_prefix text NOT NULL,
  cache_key text NOT NULL,
  value text NOT NULL,
  expires_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (key_prefix, cache_key)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_locks_expires_idx
  ON chat_state_locks (expires_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_cache_expires_idx
  ON chat_state_cache (expires_at);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_lists (
  key_prefix text NOT NULL,
  list_key text NOT NULL,
  seq bigserial NOT NULL,
  value text NOT NULL,
  expires_at timestamptz,
  PRIMARY KEY (key_prefix, list_key, seq)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_lists_expires_idx
  ON chat_state_lists (expires_at);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_queues (
  key_prefix text NOT NULL,
  thread_id text NOT NULL,
  seq bigserial NOT NULL,
  value text NOT NULL,
  expires_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (key_prefix, thread_id, seq)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS chat_state_queues_expires_idx
  ON chat_state_queues (expires_at);
```

Grant the runtime role access to the schema, all five tables, and both sequences. For example, after creating the objects in a dedicated `chat_state` schema with a separate owner:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA chat_state TO chat_runtime;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA chat_state TO chat_runtime;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA chat_state TO chat_runtime;
```

The runtime role also needs database `CONNECT` permission. It does not need schema `CREATE` permission or table ownership. Adjust the schema and role names to your deployment; these grants apply to existing objects only.

With `autoCreateSchema: false`, `connect()` checks connectivity with `SELECT 1` and then runs one read-only query to verify that all five tables exist and that the current role holds the privileges the adapter uses on each of them: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` everywhere, `UPDATE` on the locks, cache, and lists tables, and `nextval` on the list and queue sequences through either `USAGE` or `UPDATE`. Identity `seq` columns need no sequence grant. It never issues DDL. If anything is missing, `connect()` rejects with an error naming the problem, so a wrong `search_path` or a forgotten grant fails at startup instead of on the first message.

Column-level grants are supported for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE`: the probe checks each column used by the adapter, accepting either a column grant or a table-wide grant. `DELETE` is checked at the table level. The broader grants shown above remain sufficient.

Your application also owns migrations for future adapter schema changes. The changelog for `@chat-adapter/state-pg` lists the statements to run when the schema changes.

## Locking under high contention

The Redis adapters use atomic `SET NX PX` for lock acquisition. The Postgres adapter uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE WHERE expires_at <= now()`, which relies on row-level locking. This is safe for typical workloads, but under extreme contention prefer a Redis adapter.

## Expired row cleanup

Postgres does not delete expired rows automatically. The adapter cleans up as it goes: the next `acquireLock()` overwrites an expired lock, the next `get()` deletes an expired cache entry, and so on. For high-throughput deployments, run a periodic job:

```sql
DELETE FROM chat_state_locks WHERE expires_at <= now();
DELETE FROM chat_state_cache WHERE expires_at <= now();
DELETE FROM chat_state_lists WHERE expires_at <= now();
DELETE FROM chat_state_queues WHERE expires_at <= now();
```
