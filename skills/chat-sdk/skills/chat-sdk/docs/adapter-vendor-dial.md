title: Dial
description: SMS, MMS, iMessage, and inbound voice-call transcripts for Chat SDK, built and maintained by Dial. One handler answers phone traffic the same way it answers Slack/Teams/Discord — signed webhooks, thread-per-phone-pair, replies over @getdial/sdk.
tagline: Give your Chat SDK bot a phone number — SMS, MMS, iMessage in and out, plus inbound voice-call transcripts, with HMAC-signed webhooks and no channel-specific handlers.

# Dial


The Dial adapter connects [Chat SDK](https://chat-sdk.dev) bots to a **real phone number** — SMS, MMS, iMessage, and inbound voice-call transcripts, all through one adapter. The same `onNewMention` handler that already answers Slack, Teams, or Discord messages fires for phone traffic hitting your Dial number, and `thread.post` replies go back out over those channels through the official [`@getdial/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getdial/sdk).

The adapter maps a phone conversation to a Chat SDK thread (identified by the pair of phone numbers), an SMS/MMS/iMessage to a message with optional media attachments, and a completed voice call's transcript to a message on that same thread — so subscriptions, handlers, posts, and per-thread state work the same as with any other adapter.

## Feature support


## Install


For production, use a persistent state adapter such as `@chat-adapter/state-redis` instead of in-memory state.

## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";
import { createDialAdapter } from "@getdial/chat-sdk-adapter";

export const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  state: createMemoryState(),
  adapters: {
    dial: createDialAdapter({
      apiKey: process.env.DIAL_API_KEY,
      fromNumberId: process.env.DIAL_FROM_NUMBER_ID,
      webhookSecret: process.env.DIAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
    }),
  },
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`heard you: ${message.text}`);
});
```

Bind the webhook on whichever HTTP framework you use — every framework Chat SDK works on works here:

```typescript
// e.g. Next.js route handler
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  return bot.webhooks.dial(req);
}
```

## Configuration


## Webhook setup

Point a Dial webhook subscription at the endpoint you handed to `bot.webhooks.dial`. Create the subscription from the [Dial dashboard's Webhooks page](https://getdial.ai/dashboard/webhooks) or over the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.getdial.ai/api/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIAL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "targetUrl": "https://your-bot.example.com/webhook/dial", "eventTypes": ["*"] }'
```

The `whsec_…` secret returned at creation goes in `DIAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. See the [Dial Webhooks reference](https://docs.getdial.ai/documentation/platform/webhooks) for signature format, retries, and delivery semantics.

### Signature verification

When `webhookSecret` is set, every request must carry:

```
X-Dial-Signature: t=<unix_seconds>,v1=<hex-hmac-sha256(secret, `${t}.${rawBody}`)>
```

The adapter recomputes the HMAC with Node's `crypto.createHmac` + `timingSafeEqual`, rejects timestamps older than 5 minutes (replay protection), and answers `401` on any mismatch.

## What the adapter carries

| Direction | Channel              | Text              | Media                            |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Inbound   | SMS                  | ✅                 | —                                |
| Inbound   | MMS                  | ✅                 | ✅ (image / video / audio / file) |
| Inbound   | iMessage             | ✅                 | ✅                                |
| Inbound   | Voice call           | ✅ (as transcript) | —                                |
| Outbound  | SMS / MMS / iMessage | ✅                 | ✅ (via attachment URLs)          |

Voice calls surface as their transcript via the `call.transcribed` event — the adapter fetches the transcript through `@getdial/sdk.getCall()` and forwards it as a message on the caller's thread.

## Threads

A Chat SDK thread here is a **pair of phone numbers** — your Dial-owned number and the peer's — encoded as:

```
dial:{yourDialNumber}:{peerNumber}
```

Every distinct pair is a distinct thread. Chat SDK's per-thread state (subscriptions, locks, conversation memory) is scoped per-pair, so multiple concurrent conversations don't leak into each other.

## Design notes

* **Outbound sends and transcript fetches** go through the official [`@getdial/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getdial/sdk) Node SDK — no hand-rolled HTTP.
* **Signature verification** uses Node's stdlib `crypto` — HMAC-SHA256 + constant-time compare — matching the exact primitive Dial's server signs with.
* **ESM-only, TypeScript-first.** Requires Node 18+.
* Peer-depends on `chat ^4.20.0`.
