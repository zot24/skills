# Baileys (WhatsApp)


<Callout type="warn">
  This adapter uses Baileys, a third-party unofficial WhatsApp Web API. It is **not** an official WhatsApp/Meta API and may break when WhatsApp changes internal protocols. WhatsApp may also suspend or ban numbers/accounts that use unofficial automation. Use at your own risk and evaluate compliance requirements before production use.
</Callout>

## Install

<PackageInstall package="chat-adapter-baileys baileys chat @chat-adapter/state-memory" />

Optional — for terminal QR rendering during development:

<PackageInstall package="qrcode" />

## Quick start

The setup has six steps: prepare auth, create the adapter, create the `Chat` instance, register handlers, initialize, then connect. **Always register handlers before connecting** — messages can arrive as soon as `connect()` is called.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers


const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState("./auth_info");

const whatsapp = createBaileysAdapter({
  auth: { state, saveCreds },
  userName: "my-bot",
  onQR: async (qr) => {
    const QRCode = await import("qrcode");
    console.log(await QRCode.toString(qr, { type: "terminal" }));
  },
});

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "my-bot",
  adapters: { whatsapp },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`Hello ${message.author.userName}!`);
  await thread.subscribe();
});

bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  if (message.author.isMe) {
    return;
  }
  await thread.post(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});

bot.onNewMessage(/.+/, async (thread, message) => {
  if (!thread.isDM || message.author.isMe) {
    return;
  }
  await thread.post(`DM received: ${message.text}`);
});

await bot.initialize();
await whatsapp.connect();
```

Credentials are saved to `./auth_info` on first login. Subsequent startups reuse the saved session — no QR scan needed.

## Configuration

```typescript
createBaileysAdapter({
  // Unique name for this adapter — used as thread ID prefix. No ":" allowed.
  adapterName: "baileys",

  // Required. Your Baileys auth state + credential-save callback.
  auth: { state, saveCreds },

  // Display name for the bot in Chat SDK logs.
  userName: "my-bot",

  // Override the WhatsApp Web protocol version. Fetched automatically if omitted.
  version: [2, 3000, 1015901307],

  // Called with a QR string when a new QR is available.
  onQR: async (qr) => {
    /* render however you like */
  },

  // Phone number for pairing-code auth (E.164, no "+"). Use instead of onQR.
  phoneNumber: "12345678901",

  // Called with the 8-digit pairing code. User enters it in WhatsApp -> Linked Devices.
  onPairingCode: (code) => {
    /* ... */
  },

  // Advanced: extra options passed directly to Baileys' makeWASocket().
  socketOptions: {},
});
```

## Multi-account support

Run one adapter instance per WhatsApp account. Give each a unique `adapterName` to avoid thread ID collisions:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
const { state: stateMain, saveCreds: saveMain } =
  await useMultiFileAuthState("./auth_main");
const { state: stateSales, saveCreds: saveSales } =
  await useMultiFileAuthState("./auth_sales");

const waMain = createBaileysAdapter({
  adapterName: "baileys-main",
  auth: { state: stateMain, saveCreds: saveMain },
});

const waSales = createBaileysAdapter({
  adapterName: "baileys-sales",
  auth: { state: stateSales, saveCreds: saveSales },
});

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "my-bot",
  adapters: { whatsappMain: waMain, whatsappSales: waSales },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

await bot.initialize();
await waMain.connect();
await waSales.connect();
```

All handlers receive messages from both accounts. The thread ID prefix (`baileys-main:` vs `baileys-sales:`) tells you which account a message came from.

## WhatsApp extensions

`BaileysAdapter` exposes extra methods for WhatsApp features that have no Chat SDK equivalent. Branch on platform with `isBaileysAdapter()` when other adapters are also registered:

```typescript

bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  const adapter = thread.adapter;

  if (isBaileysAdapter(adapter)) {
    await adapter.markRead(
      thread.threadId,
      [message.id],
      thread.isDM ? undefined : message.author.userId
    );
    return;
  }

  await thread.post("Read receipts are not supported on this platform.");
});
```

Use `requireBaileysAdapter()` when the handler must run on WhatsApp:

```typescript

bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  const wa = requireBaileysAdapter(thread);
  await wa.reply(message, "Got it!");
});
```

| Method                                                             | Description                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `whatsapp.reply(message, text)`                                    | Send a quoted reply (native WhatsApp reply bubble) |
| `whatsapp.markRead(threadId, messageIds)`                          | Send read receipts (blue double-ticks)             |
| `whatsapp.setPresence("available" \| "unavailable")`               | Set the bot's global online/offline status         |
| `whatsapp.sendLocation(threadId, lat, lon, options?)`              | Send a native location pin                         |
| `whatsapp.sendPoll(threadId, question, options, selectableCount?)` | Send a WhatsApp poll                               |
| `whatsapp.fetchGroupParticipants(threadId)`                        | List group members with admin roles                |

## Behavior notes

* **Transport** — WebSocket-based (`connect()`), not HTTP webhooks. `handleWebhook()` returns `501`.
* **Message history** — `fetchMessages()` / `fetchChannelMessages()` return empty arrays. WhatsApp has no REST history API; persist `messages.upsert` events yourself if you need history.
* **Cards** — sent as plain-text fallback; WhatsApp has no native card format.
* **Buttons / rich interactivity** — not implemented. The adapter stays within ordinary WhatsApp chat behavior.
* **Media** — incoming attachments include a lazy `fetchData()` for on-demand binary download.
* **Reconnect** — automatic on unexpected disconnects; does not reconnect after logout or explicit `disconnect()`.
