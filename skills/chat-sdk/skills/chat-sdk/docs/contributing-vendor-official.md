# List a vendor-official adapter


A vendor-official adapter is built and maintained by the company behind the platform (or the primary maintainer of that platform's API). You implement the same `Adapter` interface as a [community adapter](/docs/contributing/building). After Vercel accepts your listing, your adapter appears in:

* The [Adapters](/adapters) page under **Vendor Official**
* The [`chat/adapters` catalog](/docs/adapters#adapter-catalog-chatadapters)
* [`create-chat-sdk`](/docs/create-chat-sdk)
* [eve.dev/integrations](https://eve.dev/integrations)

Browse current listings on the [Adapters](/adapters) page.

All three tiers share the same interface. Developers install and register your adapter the same way they use any other adapter. Vendor-official adds stronger discoverability and a higher maintenance bar.


  The `@chat-adapter/` npm scope is reserved for Vercel-maintained official adapters. Publish under your own org scope or as an unscoped package.


## Check qualifications

Before you open a listing PR, confirm that you can meet all of these:

* You will continue to maintain the adapter
* The repo lives in an official vendor-owned GitHub organization
* Your primary product docs cover the adapter
* You have announced the adapter in a blog post, changelog, or on social media
* The adapter does not depend on platform APIs that are in private or closed beta

If you don't represent the platform vendor, [list as community](/docs/contributing/publishing#listing-on-chat-sdkdev) instead.

## Review listing terms

Meeting the qualifications does not guarantee acceptance. Vercel reviews each request and may decline a listing for any reason.

If Vercel lists your adapter, you own ongoing support:

* Keep the adapter compatible with current Chat SDK APIs and your platform's APIs
* Address bug reports promptly
* Support developers who use your adapter

Vercel may remove a vendor-official adapter from the docs, catalog, eve integrations, and `create-chat-sdk` at any time, without notice. Removal can follow lack of maintenance, security or support risk, or failure to meet the tier bar.

## Build and publish your package

Ship a published npm package before you ask for a listing. Follow the same guides as community adapters:

1. [Build an adapter](/docs/contributing/building)
2. [Test it](/docs/contributing/testing)
3. [Document it](/docs/contributing/documenting)
4. [Publish it](/docs/contributing/publishing)

Your listing PR must point at that published package and a GitHub README pinned to a commit or tag.

## Submit a listing PR

Open a pull request against [vercel/chat](https://github.com/vercel/chat). Copy an existing page from [`apps/docs/content/adapters/vendor-official/`](https://github.com/vercel/chat/tree/main/apps/docs/content/adapters/vendor-official) and replace the details with yours. Choose a short kebab-case slug that is not already taken.

Include all of the following in the PR:

1. **Docs page.** Add an MDX page under `apps/docs/content/adapters/vendor-official/` and register the slug in that folder's `meta.json`. Mark the page as vendor-official, set your company as the author, complete the feature matrix, and add install and quick-start examples that match your published package and README.
2. **Adapters registry.** Add an entry to `apps/docs/adapters.json` so the adapter appears on the [Adapters](/adapters) page. Point `readme` at a pinned commit or tag, not a branch. See [Pin your README to a commit or tag](/docs/contributing/publishing#pin-your-readme-to-a-commit-or-tag). Keep the package name and flags consistent with the docs page.
3. **Catalog entry.** Add your adapter to [`chat/adapters`](/docs/adapters#adapter-catalog-chatadapters) in `packages/chat/src/adapters/index.ts`. Setup UIs use this metadata (package name, factory export, peer dependencies, and environment variables) without importing your package. Copy a similar vendor-official entry and update it from your docs.
4. **CLI scaffold.** Add a matching entry in `packages/create-chat-sdk/src/catalog/scaffold-spec.ts` so `create-chat-sdk` can generate a bot that uses your adapter. Match the factory call shape of a similar adapter. After merge, developers can pass `--adapter your_slug` or browse vendor-official adapters with `--vendor`.
5. **Test allowlists.** Update the lists in `packages/integration-tests` so CI recognizes the new docs page and package imports.
6. **Changeset.** Add a changeset that bumps `chat` and `create-chat-sdk` (patch), with one line describing the addition.

## Prepare for review

Reviewers check that:

* You meet the qualifications above
* Install snippets, factory exports, and env vars match the published package and README
* The README link is pinned to a commit or tag
* Catalog peer dependencies match what the docs tell people to install
* The adapter appears in both the docs registry and the `chat/adapters` catalog

## Keep the listing current

After merge, your adapter appears under **Vendor Official** on the [Adapters](/adapters) page, in the static catalog, on [eve.dev/integrations](https://eve.dev/integrations), and in `create-chat-sdk` when it fits the webhook-only scaffold.

When you change env vars, peer dependencies, or the factory API, open a follow-up PR that updates the docs page, catalog entry, and pinned README ref together.
