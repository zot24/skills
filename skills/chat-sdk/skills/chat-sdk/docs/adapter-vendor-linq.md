# Linq


## Install


## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";
import { createLinqAdapter } from "@linqapp/chat-sdk-adapter";

export const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "Linq Bot",
  adapters: {
    linq: createLinqAdapter({
      apiKey: process.env.LINQ_API_KEY,
      signingSecret: process.env.LINQ_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
    }),
  },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

bot.onDirectMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});

bot.onReaction(["thumbs_up"], async (event) => {
  await event.thread.post("Appreciate the tapback 🫡");
});
```

The adapter maps a Linq chat to a Chat SDK thread, a text to a message, and an iMessage tapback to a reaction, so the rest of the Chat SDK API (subscriptions, handlers, posts, reactions) works exactly the same as with any other adapter.

## Configuration


## Platform setup

1. Create a Linq account and copy your **API key**. For testing, the [Linq CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linqapp/cli) provisions a sandbox number: `linq signup --phone <your cell>`.
2. Create a **webhook subscription** pointing at the route that forwards to `bot.webhooks.linq`, and subscribe to:
   * `message.received`
   * `reaction.added`
   * `reaction.removed`
3. Copy the **signing secret** returned by the subscription into `signingSecret`.

Other event types are acknowledged with a `200` and ignored.

## Webhook events

| Event              | Role                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `message.received` | Drives Chat SDK message processing |
| `reaction.added`   | Drives reaction handlers           |
| `reaction.removed` | Drives reaction handlers           |

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/linq/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export const runtime = "nodejs"; // raw body + crypto; not edge

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  return bot.webhooks.linq(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

Requests are verified with HMAC-SHA256 and a replay-window check before dispatch; an invalid or stale signature returns **401**. Passing `waitUntil` lets work continue after the response is sent in serverless environments like Vercel.

## Thread IDs

Thread IDs are stable and always take the form `linq:{chatId}`, so a conversation maps to the same Chat SDK thread whether it first arrives via webhook or API.

### `encodeThreadId`

```typescript
adapter.encodeThreadId(data: { chatId: string; isGroup?: boolean }): string;
```

```typescript
const encoded = adapter.encodeThreadId({ chatId: "3caaf1a0-ef9f-46e0-8c22-31e82c8514dc" });
// "linq:3caaf1a0-ef9f-46e0-8c22-31e82c8514dc"
```

### `decodeThreadId`

```typescript
adapter.decodeThreadId(threadId: string): { chatId: string; isGroup?: boolean };
```

Group vs. DM identity is tracked internally from webhook payloads; legacy `linq:{chatId}:group` / `linq:{chatId}:dm` IDs still decode.

## Message format

Outbound markdown is rendered to plain text — Linq delivers message text as-is (iMessage has no markdown). Inbound text is parsed to the Chat SDK AST, with URLs surfaced as link previews.

## Reactions

Standard iMessage tapbacks map to normalized Chat SDK emoji in both directions:

| Linq tapback | Chat SDK emoji |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `like`       | `thumbs_up`    |
| `dislike`    | `thumbs_down`  |
| `love`       | `heart`        |
| `laugh`      | `laugh`        |
| `emphasize`  | `exclamation`  |
| `question`   | `question`     |

Custom emoji reactions pass through the default emoji resolver (e.g. `👍` → `thumbs_up`), falling back to the raw emoji for anything unmapped. Sticker reactions have no Chat SDK equivalent and are skipped.

## Attachments

Inbound media (images, audio, files) arrives as Chat SDK attachments with downloadable data. Outbound `attachments` and `files` are sent as Linq media parts: a public HTTPS URL under 10 MB is sent by reference, while raw bytes, non-HTTPS URLs, and files up to 100 MB are pre-uploaded. Messages can be media-only.

## Examples

* [Adapter source and README](https://github.com/linq-team/linq-chat-sdk/tree/main/packages/adapter-linq)
* [Example app](https://github.com/linq-team/linq-chat-sdk/tree/main/apps/api) — one AI bot running across Linq, Telegram, and WhatsApp from a single set of handlers.
