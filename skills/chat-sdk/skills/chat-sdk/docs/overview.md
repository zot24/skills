# Introduction


Chat SDK is a TypeScript library for building chat bots that work across multiple platforms with a single codebase. Write your bot logic once and deploy it to Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Discord, Telegram, GitHub, and Linear.

## Why Chat SDK?

Building a chat bot that works across multiple platforms typically means maintaining separate codebases, learning different APIs, and handling platform-specific quirks individually. Chat SDK abstracts these differences behind a unified interface.

* **Single codebase** for all platforms
* **Type-safe** adapters and event handlers with full TypeScript support
* **Event-driven** architecture with handlers for mentions, messages, reactions, button clicks, slash commands, and modals
* **Thread subscriptions** for multi-turn conversations
* **Rich UI** with JSX cards, buttons, and modals that render natively on each platform
* **AI streaming** with first-class support for streaming LLM responses
* **Serverless-ready** with distributed state via Redis and message deduplication

## How it works

Chat SDK has three core concepts:

1. **Chat** — the main entry point that coordinates adapters and routes events to your handlers
2. **Adapters** — platform-specific implementations that handle webhook parsing, message formatting, and API calls
3. **State** — a pluggable persistence layer for thread subscriptions and distributed locking

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createSlackAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/slack";
import { createRedisState } from "@chat-adapter/state-redis";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    slack: createSlackAdapter(),
  },
  state: createRedisState(),
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread) => {
  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post("Hello! I'm listening to this thread.");
});
```

Each adapter factory auto-detects credentials from environment variables (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `REDIS_URL`, etc.), so you can get started with zero config. Pass explicit values to override.

## Supported platforms

| Platform        | Package                  | Mentions | Reactions | Cards   | Modals | Streaming | DMs |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | --------- | ------- | ------ | --------- | --- |
| Slack           | `@chat-adapter/slack`    | Yes      | Yes       | Yes     | Yes    | Native    | Yes |
| Microsoft Teams | `@chat-adapter/teams`    | Yes      | Read-only | Yes     | No     | Post+Edit | Yes |

## AI coding agent support

If you use an AI coding agent like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), you can teach it about Chat SDK by installing the skill:

```bash
npx skills add vercel/chat
```

This gives your agent access to Chat SDK's documentation, patterns, and best practices so it can help you build bots more effectively.

## Packages

The SDK is distributed as a set of packages you install based on your needs:
