# Slash Commands


Slash commands let users invoke your bot with `/command` syntax. Register handlers with `onSlashCommand` to respond.

Slash commands are supported on [Slack](/adapters/official/slack), [Discord](/adapters/official/discord), and [Telegram](/adapters/official/telegram).

## Handle a specific command

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSlashCommand("/status", async (event) => {
  await event.channel.post("All systems operational!");
});
```

## Handle multiple commands

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSlashCommand(["/help", "/info"], async (event) => {
  await event.channel.post(`You invoked ${event.command}`);
});
```

## Catch-all handler

Register a handler without a command to catch all slash commands:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSlashCommand(async (event) => {
  console.log(`Command: ${event.command}, Args: ${event.text}`);
});
```

## SlashCommandEvent

The `event` object passed to slash command handlers:

| Property    | Type                                                  | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `command`   | `string`                                              | The command name (e.g., `/status`)        |
| `text`      | `string`                                              | Arguments after the command               |
| `user`      | `Author`                                              | The user who invoked the command          |
| `channel`   | `Channel`                                             | The channel where the command was invoked |
| `adapter`   | `Adapter`                                             | The platform adapter                      |
| `triggerId` | `string` (optional)                                   | Platform trigger ID for opening modals    |
| `openModal` | `(modal) => Promise<{ viewId: string } \| undefined>` | Open a modal dialog                       |
| `raw`       | `unknown`                                             | Platform-specific payload                 |

## Respond to a command

Use `event.channel` to post messages:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSlashCommand("/greet", async (event) => {
  // Public message to the channel
  await event.channel.post(`Hello, ${event.user.fullName}!`);

  // Ephemeral message (only visible to the user)
  await event.channel.postEphemeral(
    event.user,
    "This message is just for you!",
    { fallbackToDM: false }
  );
});
```

## Open a modal

Use `event.openModal()` to open a [modal](/docs/modals) in response to a slash command:

```tsx title="lib/bot.tsx" lineNumbers

bot.onSlashCommand("/feedback", async (event) => {
  const result = await event.openModal(
    <Modal callbackId="feedback_form" title="Send Feedback" submitLabel="Send">
      <TextInput id="message" label="Your Feedback" multiline />
      <Select id="category" label="Category">
        <SelectOption label="Bug" value="bug" />
        <SelectOption label="Feature" value="feature" />
      </Select>
    </Modal>
  );

  if (!result) {
    await event.channel.post("Couldn't open the feedback form. Please try again.");
  }
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  When a modal is opened from a slash command, the submit handler receives `relatedChannel` instead of `relatedThread`. Use this to post back to the channel where the command was invoked.
</Callout>

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onModalSubmit("feedback_form", async (event) => {
  const { message, category } = event.values;

  // Post to the channel where the slash command was invoked
  if (event.relatedChannel) {
    await event.relatedChannel.post(`Feedback received! Category: ${category}`);
  }
});
```

## Telegram

Telegram supports bot commands such as `/status` and `/status@mybot`. Register handlers with `onSlashCommand`; commands addressed to another bot are ignored as slash commands and continue through the normal message path.

## Discord

Discord slash commands are received via [HTTP Interactions](/adapters/official/discord#http-interactions-vs-gateway) — no Gateway connection is needed. The adapter automatically sends a deferred response to Discord, then resolves it when your handler calls `event.channel.post()`.

To make selected Discord slash command responses ephemeral, return `DiscordInteractionResponseFlag.Ephemeral` from the Discord adapter's [`interactionFlags` option](/adapters/official/discord#interaction-flags).

### Subcommands

Discord supports subcommand groups and subcommands. The adapter flattens these into the `event.command` path:

| Discord command                       | `event.command`       | `event.text` |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| `/status`                             | `/status`             | `""`         |
| `/project create --name="Acme"`       | `/project create`     | `Acme`       |
| `/project issue list --status="open"` | `/project issue list` | `open`       |

For full option details (names, types), use `event.raw` to access the original Discord interaction payload.

### Registering commands with Discord

You need to register slash commands with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands) before they appear in the client. The Chat SDK handles incoming commands but does not register them for you.
