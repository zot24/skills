# Direct Messages


Open direct message conversations with users using `bot.openDM()`. For globally recognizable user IDs, the adapter is automatically inferred from the ID format.

## DM behavior

DMs behave slightly differently from channel messages:

* **Direct message handlers** — if you register `onDirectMessage`, every incoming DM routes there before `onSubscribedMessage`, `onNewMention`, and pattern handlers. This keeps DM-centric flows like WhatsApp conversations, Telegram DMs, and web chat on one consistent handler.
* **Mention fallback** — if no `onDirectMessage` handlers are registered, DMs continue through normal routing. Unsubscribed DMs are treated as mentions, so existing `onNewMention` bots keep working without requiring the user to @-mention the bot.
* **Per-conversation threading** — Each top-level DM starts a new conversation. Thread replies within a DM continue the same conversation, giving you the same per-thread isolation as channels.

## Handle incoming DMs

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onDirectMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});
```

## Open a DM

### From an Author object

The most common pattern — use the `author` from an incoming message:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  if (message.text === "DM me") {
    const dmThread = await bot.openDM(message.author);
    await dmThread.post("Hello! This is a private message.");
  }
});
```

### From a user ID

Pass a user ID string directly. The adapter is inferred from the ID format:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts"
const dmThread = await bot.openDM("U1234567890"); // Slack
```

| Format          | Platform            |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| `U...` / `W...` | Slack               |
| `29:...`        | Teams               |
| `users/...`     | Google Chat         |
| Numeric ID      | Discord or Telegram |

<Callout type="info">
  Numeric IDs can be ambiguous when multiple numeric-ID adapters are registered. For platforms whose user IDs are not globally distinguishable, call the adapter directly and wrap the returned thread ID with `bot.thread()`.
</Callout>

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts"
const threadId = await bot.getAdapter("whatsapp").openDM("15551234567");
const dmThread = bot.thread(threadId);
```

## Check if a thread is a DM

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  if (thread.isDM) {
    await thread.post("This is a private conversation.");
  }
});
```
