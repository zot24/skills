# Cloudflare Agents


## Install


## Quick start

Import the adapter from `agents/chat-sdk` when you run [Chat SDK](https://chat-sdk.dev) inside a [Cloudflare Agent](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/). Each state shard is a `ChatSdkStateAgent` sub-agent under your ingress Agent, and the adapter works with any Chat SDK platform adapter, including Telegram, Slack, Discord, Teams, and Google Chat.

Create a parent Agent that owns your Chat SDK runtime and pass `createChatSdkState()` as the `state` option. Export `ChatSdkStateAgent` from your Worker entry point so sub-agent routing can resolve it.

```typescript title="src/index.ts" lineNumbers
import { Agent } from "agents";
import { createChatSdkState } from "agents/chat-sdk";
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createTelegramAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/telegram";

export { ChatSdkStateAgent } from "agents/chat-sdk";

export class MessengerAgent extends Agent<Env> {
  private chat!: Chat;

  onStart() {
    const telegram = createTelegramAdapter({
      botToken: this.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN,
      mode: "webhook",
      userName: "my_bot",
    });

    this.chat = new Chat({
      adapters: { telegram },
      userName: "my_bot",
      state: createChatSdkState(),
      concurrency: { strategy: "burst", debounceMs: 600 },
    });
  }
}
```

When `createChatSdkState()` runs inside an Agent lifecycle method or request handler, it gets the current Agent from `getCurrentAgent()`, uses it as the parent, and creates state shards with `this.subAgent()`.

## Configuration

Pass these options to `createChatSdkState()`. All of them are optional:


## Wrangler configuration

Add the parent Agent to your Durable Object migration and enable `nodejs_compat`:

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "compatibility_date": "2026-07-02",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [{ "class_name": "MessengerAgent", "name": "MessengerAgent" }]
  },
  "migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["MessengerAgent"] }]
}
```

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
compatibility_date = "2026-07-02"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
class_name = "MessengerAgent"
name = "MessengerAgent"

[[migrations]]
new_sqlite_classes = ["MessengerAgent"]
tag = "v1"
```

## Data model

The adapter implements the full Chat SDK `StateAdapter` interface:

* Subscriptions for `thread.subscribe()` and `thread.unsubscribe()`.
* Locks for per-thread or per-channel concurrency.
* Pending message queues for `queue`, `debounce`, and `burst` concurrency strategies.
* Generic key-value cache entries with optional TTL.
* Append-only lists with max-length trimming and list-level TTL refresh.

Chat SDK builds message deduplication, thread and channel state, callback URL token storage, modal context storage, and cross-platform transcripts on these primitives. Persistent thread history uses them too, for adapters that opt in to `persistThreadHistory`.

## State sharding

By default, state is sharded by the first two colon-separated segments of a thread-like key. For example, `telegram:-100123:456` and `telegram:-100123:789` share the shard `telegram:-100123`.

The default key sharder recognizes these Chat SDK key prefixes:

* `thread-state:`
* `channel-state:`
* `msg-history:`
* `transcripts:user:`

Unknown keys use the adapter's default shard name, `default`.

Telegram Business threads (`telegram:biz:{connectionId}:{chatId}`) all share the shard `telegram:biz` under this rule. Use a custom `shardKey` that keeps the connection ID if you expect many business conversations.

### Custom sharding

Use `shardKey` to control how thread IDs map to state sub-agent names, and `keyShard` for non-thread-shaped keys that should still route to a provider-specific shard:

```typescript
const state = createChatSdkState({
  shardKey(threadId) {
    return threadId.split(":").slice(0, 2).join(":");
  },
  keyShard(key) {
    if (!key.startsWith("dedupe:telegram:")) {
      return undefined;
    }

    const chatId = key.slice("dedupe:telegram:".length).split(":")[0];
    return chatId ? `telegram:${chatId}` : undefined;
  },
});
```

Returning `undefined` from `keyShard` falls back to the built-in key sharder and then to the default shard.

## Cleanup behavior

TTL reads are strict: expired locks, cache values, queue entries, and list entries are ignored or deleted before they are returned.

Physical cleanup is lazy. `ChatSdkStateAgent` schedules one cleanup callback for the earliest known expiry and reschedules after cleanup runs, so idle shards stay quiet and expired rows don't accumulate.

## API

### `createChatSdkState(options)`

Creates a Chat SDK `StateAdapter` backed by a `ChatSdkStateAgent` sub-agent. With no options, it resolves the parent from `getCurrentAgent()` and shards by thread-like key prefixes. See [Configuration](#configuration) for the full option list.

### `ChatSdkStateAgent`

The sub-agent class that stores state in SQLite. Export it from your Worker entry point so the runtime can create it:

```typescript
export { ChatSdkStateAgent } from "agents/chat-sdk";
```
