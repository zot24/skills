# Vercel Connect


[Vercel Connect](https://vercel.com/docs/connect) lets your bot use a registered connector for adapter authentication instead of storing long-lived provider secrets. You register a connector once, link it to your project and environments, and your code requests scoped, short-lived tokens at runtime.

The `@vercel/connect/chat` subpath ships a helper per platform that you spread into the matching `create*Adapter` factory.

## Adapter support

| Adapter                                     | Helper                   | Outbound field              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| [Slack](/adapters/official/slack)           | `connectSlackAdapter`    | `botToken`                  |
| [Microsoft Teams](/adapters/official/teams) | `connectTeamsAdapter`    | `appId`, `token`            |
| [GitHub](/adapters/official/github)         | `connectGitHubAdapter`   | `installationToken`         |
| [Linear](/adapters/official/linear)         | `connectLinearAdapter`   | `accessToken`               |
| [Discord](/adapters/official/discord)       | `connectDiscordAdapter`  | `botToken`, `applicationId` |
| [Notion](/adapters/official/notion)         | `connectNotionAdapter`   | `token`                     |
| [Telegram](/adapters/official/telegram)     | `connectTelegramAdapter` | `botToken`                  |

Every helper wires outbound credentials. Helpers for trigger-capable providers also wire inbound traffic:

* Outbound, when your bot calls the provider API: the helper sets a function-form token field that resolves a fresh, short-lived token per call via `getToken`.
* Inbound, when the provider calls your bot: trigger-capable helpers include a `webhookVerifier` that validates the Vercel OIDC token Connect attaches to [trigger-forwarded](https://vercel.com/docs/connect/concepts/triggers) webhooks. It replaces the provider's native signature check.

Each helper accepts `(connector, params?, options?)`, where `params` is the [`getToken`](https://vercel.com/docs/connect/ts-sdk-reference) parameters minus `subject`, which is pinned to `{ type: "app" }`. Use `params` to pass supported token parameters such as `installationId` or `validityBufferMs`.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @vercel/connect
```

`@vercel/connect` reads the deployment's OIDC token automatically. For local development, run `vercel link` followed by `vercel env pull` to download a short-lived token into `.env.local`.

## Set up a connector

The trigger-forwarding steps below apply to Slack, Microsoft Teams, GitHub, Linear, and Discord.
For Notion and Telegram, create and attach the connector without triggers, then
use native webhook verification or polling.

1. Create a connector for the provider in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F~%2Fconnect) or with the CLI, enabling trigger forwarding so inbound webhooks reach your project:

```bash
vercel connect create slack --name acme-slack --triggers
```

2. Attach your project and register your Chat SDK webhook route (`/api/webhooks/{platform}`) as the trigger destination:

```bash
vercel connect attach slack/acme-slack \
  --project my-bot --environment production \
  --triggers --trigger-path /api/webhooks/slack
```

3. Pull a development token locally (deployments get `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` automatically):

```bash
vercel link
vercel env pull
```

## Wire up the adapter

Spread the helper into the adapter factory. The webhook route stays the same, because Connect forwards verified events to the same handler.

### Slack

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createSlackAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/slack";
import { createRedisState } from "@chat-adapter/state-redis";
import { connectSlackAdapter } from "@vercel/connect/chat";

export const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    slack: createSlackAdapter({
      ...connectSlackAdapter("slack/acme-slack"),
    }),
  },
  state: createRedisState(),
});
```

Replace `slack/acme-slack` with your connector UID from the Connect dashboard or `vercel connect list`. Omit `signingSecret` and `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` when using the helper. The OIDC `webhookVerifier` is the freshness boundary instead.

### Microsoft Teams

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { createTeamsAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/teams";
import { connectTeamsAdapter } from "@vercel/connect/chat";

createTeamsAdapter({
  ...connectTeamsAdapter("microsoft-teams/acme-teams"),
});
```

The helper resolves the bot's `appId` during initialization, requests separate Bot Framework and Microsoft Graph tokens through `token`, and supplies OIDC verification for forwarded webhooks. Enable trigger forwarding to `/api/webhooks/teams`. Omit `TEAMS_APP_ID` and `TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD` when using the helper.

Teams excludes `scopes` from helper parameters: its token callback requests the scope required by each API call.

Graph reads require the appropriate installation and consent permissions. Managed tokens use the bot's home tenant; the adapter's token callback tenant argument does not change that selection. Call `await bot.initialize()` before using adapter methods directly. Chat initializes automatically before processing webhooks.

### GitHub

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { createGitHubAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/github";
import { connectGitHubAdapter } from "@vercel/connect/chat";

createGitHubAdapter({
  ...connectGitHubAdapter("github/acme-github"),
  userName: "my-bot[bot]",
  botUserId: 12345678, // Numeric ID of your GitHub App bot user
});
```

`installationToken` is the installation access token a GitHub App would normally mint via its private-key JWT exchange. The adapter uses it directly and skips that exchange.

Set `botUserId` to your GitHub App bot user's numeric ID, or set `GITHUB_BOT_USER_ID`. An installation token cannot identify the bot through `/app`, and learning the ID from a posted comment only lasts for that process. Configuring it up front lets every serverless instance recognize its own comments and avoid self-reply loops. See the [GitHub adapter setup](/adapters/official/github#vercel-connect) for how to find the ID.

### Linear

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { createLinearAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/linear";
import { connectLinearAdapter } from "@vercel/connect/chat";

createLinearAdapter({
  ...connectLinearAdapter("linear/acme-linear"),
  mode: "agent-sessions",
});
```

We recommend `mode: "agent-sessions"` for Linear Connect bots. Enable **Agent session events** on the Linear app and use an app-actor installation. Projects generated with `create-chat-sdk --adapter linear --connect` include this mode explicitly. The adapter still defaults to `"comments"` when `mode` is omitted, so existing bots keep their behavior. For outbound calls outside webhook handling (cron jobs, workflows), wrap them in `withInstallation()` so a request-scoped client is bound:

```typescript title="lib/jobs.ts" lineNumbers
await linear.withInstallation("org-id", async () => {
  await linear.postMessage("linear:issue-id", "Hello from a background job");
});
```

### Discord

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { createDiscordAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/discord";
import { connectDiscordAdapter } from "@vercel/connect/chat";

createDiscordAdapter({
  ...connectDiscordAdapter("discord/acme-discord"),
});
```

The helper resolves `botToken` and `applicationId` from one Connect token
response. Omit `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`, and
`DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`. Connect OIDC verification replaces Discord's
Ed25519 public-key check for trigger-forwarded interactions.

### Notion

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { createNotionAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/notion";
import { connectNotionAdapter } from "@vercel/connect/chat";

createNotionAdapter({
  ...connectNotionAdapter("notion/acme-notion"),
  verificationToken: process.env.NOTION_VERIFICATION_TOKEN,
});
```

`connectNotionAdapter` supplies only the outbound `token`; it does not include a
`webhookVerifier`. Connect does not forward Notion triggers, so configure the
webhook subscription directly in Notion and retain
`NOTION_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` for native HMAC verification. Omit
`NOTION_TOKEN` when using the helper.

### Telegram

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { createTelegramAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/telegram";
import { connectTelegramAdapter } from "@vercel/connect/chat";

createTelegramAdapter({
  ...connectTelegramAdapter("telegram/acme-telegram"),
  secretToken: process.env.TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN,
});
```

`connectTelegramAdapter` supplies only the outbound `botToken`; it does not
include a `webhookVerifier`. The adapter derives webhook deduplication scope
from Telegram's stable bot identity, not the rotating credential. Retain
`TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN` for native webhook verification or use polling
mode. Omit `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` when using the helper.

## Custom webhook verification

Each trigger-capable helper attaches a default verifier that matches the deployment's project and environment. `projectId` defaults to `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, and `environment` defaults to `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV`, then `VERCEL_ENV`. As a result, production, preview, and development each accept only their own tokens. Verification fails closed: if those values are absent, every request is rejected. The issuer must be `https://oidc.vercel.com` or a Vercel team issuer beneath `https://oidc.vercel.com/`.

To add constraints, such as accepting multiple environments, build a verifier with `createConnectWebhookVerifier` and override the field:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import {
  connectSlackAdapter,
  createConnectWebhookVerifier,
} from "@vercel/connect/chat";

createSlackAdapter({
  ...connectSlackAdapter("slack/acme-slack"),
  webhookVerifier: createConnectWebhookVerifier({
    environment: ["production", "preview"],
  }),
});
```


  Avoid hardcoding `environment: "production"` unless you only forward to production. That verifier rejects preview and development deployments.


## Notes and limitations

* The helpers use app-scoped tokens and act as the application itself (`subject: { type: "app" }`). End-user OAuth is a separate concern.
* OIDC verification replaces each provider's native signature and timestamp check. Request freshness relies on the short-lived OIDC token's expiry rather than a signed timestamp, and there is no built-in delivery de-duplication, so keep your webhook handlers idempotent.
* Connect trigger forwarding is HTTP-only, so it doesn't work with the Slack adapter's Socket Mode.
* Connect forwards to deployed URLs, not `localhost`. Test against a preview or development deployment.
