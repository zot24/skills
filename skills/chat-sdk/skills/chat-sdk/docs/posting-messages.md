# Posting Messages


`thread.post()` accepts several message formats, each suited to different use cases. Choose the format that best fits your content — from plain strings to structured AST to rich interactive cards.

## Plain text

The simplest option. Pass a string and it goes through as-is to the platform.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
await thread.post("Hello world");
```

This sends the string directly without any formatting conversion.

## Markdown

Pass a `{ markdown }` object to have the SDK render standard markdown on each platform — passed through to Slack's native `markdown_text` field, converted to HTML for Teams, and so on.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
await thread.post({
  markdown: "**Bold**, _italic_, and `code`",
});
```

Under the hood, the SDK parses the markdown into an mdast AST, then each adapter handles it natively or converts it to the platform's format.

## AST builders

For programmatic control over message formatting, use the mdast AST builder functions exported from `chat`. This is the recommended approach for most use cases — it gives you fine-grained control without the overhead of card rendering.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers

await thread.post({
  ast: root([
    paragraph([
      strong([text("Deployment complete")]),
      text(" — "),
      link("https://example.com", [text("View site")]),
    ]),
  ]),
});
```

### Available builders

| Builder                       | Description                  | Example                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `root(children)`              | Root node (required wrapper) | `root([paragraph([...])])`               |
| `paragraph(children)`         | Paragraph block              | `paragraph([text("Hello")])`             |
| `text(value)`                 | Plain text                   | `text("Hello")`                          |
| `strong(children)`            | **Bold** text                | `strong([text("bold")])`                 |
| `emphasis(children)`          | *Italic* text                | `emphasis([text("italic")])`             |
| `strikethrough(children)`     | ~~Strikethrough~~ text       | `strikethrough([text("done")])`          |
| `inlineCode(value)`           | `Inline code`                | `inlineCode("const x = 1")`              |
| `codeBlock(value, lang?)`     | Fenced code block            | `codeBlock("const x = 1", "ts")`         |
| `link(url, children, title?)` | Hyperlink                    | `link("https://...", [text("click")])`   |
| `blockquote(children)`        | Block quote                  | `blockquote([paragraph([text("...")])])` |

### Parsing markdown to AST

You can also parse a markdown string into an AST, manipulate it, then send it:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers

const ast = parseMarkdown("**Hello** world");
// Manipulate the AST...
await thread.post({ ast });
```

## Cards

When you need interactive elements like buttons, dropdowns, or structured layouts, use cards. Cards render natively on each platform — Block Kit on Slack, Adaptive Cards on Teams, and Google Chat Cards.

### Function syntax

Use the function-call API for type-safe card construction:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers

await thread.post(
  Card({
    title: "Order #1234",
    children: [
      Text("Your order has been received!"),
      Actions([
        Button({ id: "approve", label: "Approve", style: "primary" }),
        Button({ id: "reject", label: "Reject", style: "danger" }),
      ]),
    ],
  })
);
```

### JSX syntax

You can also use JSX if you configure the `chat` JSX runtime:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "chat"
  }
}
```

```tsx title="lib/bot.tsx"

await thread.post(

    Your order has been received!
    <Actions>
      <Button id="approve" style="primary">Approve</Button>
      <Button id="reject" style="danger">Reject</Button>
    </Actions>

);
```

<Callout type="warn">
  The JSX syntax requires `jsxImportSource: "chat"` in your `tsconfig.json` (or a per-file `/** @jsxImportSource chat */` pragma). Without this, TypeScript won't recognize the card JSX types. If you run into type issues with JSX, use the function-call syntax instead — it produces the same output with better type inference.
</Callout>

See the [Cards](/docs/cards) page for the full list of card components.

## Streaming

Pass an AI SDK stream to `thread.post()` to stream a message in real time. The SDK uses platform-native streaming where available and falls back to post-then-edit or buffered delivery depending on the platform.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({ model, instructions: "You are a helpful assistant." });
const result = await agent.stream({ prompt: message.text });
await thread.post(result.fullStream);
```

Both `fullStream` and `textStream` are supported. Use `fullStream` with multi-step agents — it preserves paragraph breaks between steps. Any `AsyncIterable<string>` also works for custom streams.

For multi-turn conversations, use [`toAiMessages()`](/docs/ai/to-ai-messages) to convert thread history into the `{ role, content }[]` format expected by AI SDKs.

To pass platform-specific streaming options (e.g. Slack task grouping or stop blocks), wrap the stream in a [`StreamingPlan`](/docs/streaming#streaming-with-options) and post that.

See the [Streaming](/docs/streaming) page for details on platform behavior and configuration.

## Attachments and files

Any structured message format (`markdown`, `ast`, or `card`) supports `files` for uploading attachments alongside the message:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
await thread.post({
  markdown: "Here's the report:",
  files: [{ data: buffer, filename: "report.pdf" }],
});
```

Use `attachments` on `{ raw }`, `{ markdown }`, or `{ ast }` when an adapter supports typed media uploads, such as Telegram's single image/audio/video/file upload support.

See the [Files](/docs/files) page for more on attachments.

## Choosing a format

| Format                                                    | Use when                                          | Example                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Plain string                                              | Simple, unformatted text                          | Status updates, acknowledgements                  |
| `{ markdown }`                                            | You have a markdown string (e.g. from a template) | Notifications with links and formatting           |
| `{ ast }`                                                 | You need programmatic formatting control          | Dynamic messages built from data                  |
| Card (function)                                           | You need buttons, fields, or structured layouts   | Approval flows, dashboards                        |
| Card (JSX)                                                | Same as above, with JSX syntax preference         | Same use cases as function cards                  |
| `AsyncIterable`                                           | Streaming AI responses                            | Chat with LLMs                                    |
| [`Plan`](/docs/streaming#plan-api)                        | Step-by-step tasks that mutate after posting      | Multi-step agents, deploy progress                |
| [`StreamingPlan`](/docs/streaming#streaming-with-options) | Streaming with platform-specific options          | Slack streaming with grouped tasks or stop blocks |

For most cases, **AST builders** give the best balance of control and simplicity. Reach for **cards** when you need interactive elements like buttons or dropdowns.
