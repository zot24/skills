# CLI


`create-chat-sdk` creates a minimal Next.js app for Chat SDK bots.

The CLI will generate your `Chat` configuration, webhook route, `.env.example` file, dependencies, and optional Web adapter route from the adapter catalog.

## Quick start

<CodeBlockTabs defaultValue="npm">
  <CodeBlockTabsList>
    <CodeBlockTabsTrigger value="npm">
      npm
    </CodeBlockTabsTrigger>

    <CodeBlockTabsTrigger value="pnpm">
      pnpm
    </CodeBlockTabsTrigger>

    <CodeBlockTabsTrigger value="yarn">
      yarn
    </CodeBlockTabsTrigger>

    <CodeBlockTabsTrigger value="bun">
      bun
    </CodeBlockTabsTrigger>
  </CodeBlockTabsList>

  <CodeBlockTab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm create chat-sdk@latest my-bot
    ```
  </CodeBlockTab>

  <CodeBlockTab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm create chat-sdk@latest my-bot
    ```
  </CodeBlockTab>

  <CodeBlockTab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn create chat-sdk my-bot
    ```
  </CodeBlockTab>

  <CodeBlockTab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx create-chat-sdk@latest my-bot
    ```
  </CodeBlockTab>
</CodeBlockTabs>


  `create-chat-sdk` automatically detects when it is being run by Cursor, Claude Code, or another coding agent. In agent environments, pass at least one platform adapter with `--adapter`; the state adapter defaults to `memory`. The CLI runs non-interactively and uses `my-bot` when no project name is provided. Pass `--interactive` to force prompts.


## Non-interactive usage

Pass platform and state adapters with `--adapter`:

```bash
npm create chat-sdk@latest -- my-bot --adapter slack redis -y
```


  With npm, the `--` separator is required because npm consumes flags before it (`-y` is npm's own `--yes`) instead of forwarding them to the CLI. `pnpm create` and `yarn create` forward flags without it.


The interactive prompt lists official adapters by default. Pass `--vendor` to list only vendor-official adapters instead. Automation and coding agents can install any CLI-supported official or vendor adapter directly with `--adapter`.

Adapters that require a long-running process, including Matrix and Lark, cannot run on the webhook-only serverless runtime and are not available through the CLI. Add them to an existing project manually instead.

<AdapterSlugList />

Examples:

```bash
npm create chat-sdk@latest -- slack-bot --adapter slack memory -y --skip-install
npm create chat-sdk@latest -- gchat-bot --adapter gchat redis -y --pm pnpm
npm create chat-sdk@latest -- email-bot --adapter resend postgres -y --no-git
npm create chat-sdk@latest -- my-bot --adapter slack memory -y --force
```

## What gets generated

The scaffolded app is webhook-only. It does not include pages, layouts, or a client UI.

```txt
src/
  lib/bot.ts                              Bot configuration and handlers
  app/api/webhooks/[platform]/route.ts    Dynamic platform webhook route
  app/api/chat/route.ts                   Web adapter route, only when selected
  app/api/discord/gateway/route.ts        Discord Gateway listener, only when selected
.env.example                              Required environment variables
next.config.ts                            Next.js server config
vercel.json                               Cron schedules, only when needed
.chat-sdk.json                            Generated file ownership for safe reruns
package.json                              Adapter dependencies
```

Webhook endpoints use the selected adapter slug:

```txt
/api/webhooks/slack
/api/webhooks/gchat
/api/webhooks/discord
```

When the [Web adapter](/adapters/official/web) is selected, the CLI also creates `/api/chat` for browser chat requests and a small `getUser` auth stub. Replace the stub with your app's real authentication logic so each web conversation can be associated with the correct user.

When the [Discord adapter](/adapters/official/discord) is selected, the CLI also creates a Gateway listener at `/api/discord/gateway` and a `vercel.json` cron that calls it. Discord delivers slash commands and button clicks to the webhook route, but regular messages and reactions only arrive over the Gateway WebSocket, so the cron keeps that connection alive and forwards events to `/api/webhooks/discord`. Set a `CRON_SECRET` environment variable to authenticate the cron requests. The generated serverless Gateway cron requires [Vercel Pro or Enterprise](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/usage-and-pricing) because it runs every nine minutes.

## Vercel Connect

[Vercel Connect](/docs/vercel-connect) supplies outbound credentials for the Slack, Discord, GitHub, Linear, Notion, and Telegram adapters. Pass `--connect` — or choose **Vercel Connect** at the interactive auth-mode prompt — to scaffold Connect wiring for any selected adapter in that list. Notion and Telegram webhooks remain direct and retain their native verification secrets.

```bash
npm create chat-sdk@latest -- my-bot --adapter slack --connect -y
```

The generated `src/lib/bot.ts` spreads the matching helper from `@vercel/connect/chat` into the adapter factory, `@vercel/connect` is added to dependencies, and `.env.example` lists each connector UID (for example `SLACK_CONNECTOR`). Native webhook verification secrets are retained for adapters such as Notion and Telegram.


  Vercel Connect provides `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` at runtime. For local development, run `vercel link` then `vercel env pull` to populate it. Connect forwards inbound webhooks only to deployed URLs, so test webhook delivery against a Vercel deployment (such as a preview) rather than localhost.

Color output follows the [NO\_COLOR standard](https://no-color.org/) — set `NO_COLOR=1` to disable colors.

## Customize your bot

Most bot behavior lives in `src/lib/bot.ts`. Start there when you want to:

* Add or change handlers like `onNewMention`, `onSubscribedMessage`, `onNewMessage`, reactions, actions, or slash commands.
* Adjust adapter configuration, for example passing explicit credentials or platform-specific options instead of relying only on environment variables.
* If you selected the memory state adapter, switch to Redis, ioredis, or PostgreSQL before deploying to production.

The generated file includes starter handlers for mentions and subscribed thread replies.

## Next steps

After scaffolding:

```bash
cd my-bot
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Fill in the generated environment variables, expose your local server, and configure each selected platform to call its `/api/webhooks/{adapter}` endpoint.
