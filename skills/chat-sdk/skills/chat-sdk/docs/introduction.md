# Introduction


Chat SDK is a TypeScript library for building chat bots that work across multiple platforms with a single codebase. Write your bot logic once and deploy it wherever you have an [adapter](/adapters).

## Why Chat SDK?

Building a chat bot that works across multiple platforms typically means maintaining separate codebases, learning different APIs, and handling platform-specific quirks individually. Chat SDK abstracts these differences behind a unified interface.

* **Single codebase** for all platforms
* **Type-safe** [adapters](/adapters) and event handlers with full TypeScript support
* **Event-driven** architecture with handlers for mentions, messages, reactions, button clicks, slash commands, and modals
* **Thread subscriptions** for multi-turn conversations
* **Rich UI** with JSX cards, buttons, and modals that render natively on each platform
* **AI streaming** with first-class support for streaming LLM responses
* **Serverless-ready** with distributed state via Redis and message deduplication

## How it works

Chat SDK has three core concepts:

1. **Chat** — the main entry point that coordinates [adapters](/adapters) and routes events to your handlers
2. **[Adapters](/adapters)** — platform-specific implementations that handle webhook parsing, message formatting, and API calls
3. **State** — a pluggable persistence layer for thread subscriptions and distributed locking

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createSlackAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/slack";
import { createRedisState } from "@chat-adapter/state-redis";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    slack: createSlackAdapter(),
  },
  state: createRedisState(),
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread) => {
  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post("Hello! I'm listening to this thread.");
});
```

Each adapter factory auto-detects credentials from environment variables (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `REDIS_URL`, etc.), so you can get started with zero config. Pass explicit values to override.

## Adapters

Install only the adapters you need. Browse the full catalog on the [Adapters](/adapters) page, and compare official platform features on [Platform Adapters](/docs/platform-adapters#feature-matrix).


## AI coding agents

If you use an AI coding agent such as OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, or Cursor, install the Chat SDK skill so it knows the SDK APIs, adapter patterns, and project conventions before writing code.

```bash
npx skills add vercel/chat
```

The skill references bundled documentation in `node_modules/chat/docs`, plus adapter guides and starter templates in the published package.

You can also install the [Vercel Plugin](https://vercel.com/plugin) for a broader agent toolkit. It includes the Chat SDK skill alongside specialist agents, slash commands, and more:

```bash
npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin
```

For agent-readable documentation, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt) (page index) or [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) (full text).

## Contributing

Ship an adapter for a new platform, or list a vendor-maintained one in the catalog.
