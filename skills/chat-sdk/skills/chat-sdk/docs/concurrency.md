# Overlapping Messages


When multiple messages arrive on the same thread while a handler is still processing, the SDK needs a strategy. By default, the incoming message is dropped. The `concurrency` option on `ChatConfig` lets you choose what happens instead.

## Strategies

### Drop (default)

The original behavior. If a handler is already running on a thread, the new message is discarded and a `LockError` is thrown. No queuing, no retries.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts"
const bot = new Chat({
  concurrency: "drop",
  // ...
});
```

### Queue

Messages that arrive while a handler is running are enqueued. When the current handler finishes, only the **latest** queued message is dispatched. All intermediate messages are provided as `context.skipped`, giving your handler full visibility into what happened while it was busy.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
const bot = new Chat({
  concurrency: "queue",
  // ...
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message, context) => {
  if (context && context.skipped.length > 0) {
    await thread.post(
      `You sent ${context.totalSinceLastHandler} messages while I was thinking. Responding to your latest.`
    );
  }

  const response = await generateAIResponse(message.text);
  await thread.post(response);
});
```

**Flow:**

```
A arrives  → acquire lock → process A
B arrives  → lock busy → enqueue B
C arrives  → lock busy → enqueue C
D arrives  → lock busy → enqueue D
A done     → drain: [B, C, D] → handler(D, { skipped: [B, C] })
D done     → queue empty → release lock
```

### Burst

Waits for `debounceMs` before the first handler on an idle thread, then drains the collected burst like `queue`. The latest message is dispatched, and earlier messages in the burst are available as `context.skipped`.

Use this for assistant-style bots where users often send one logical turn as several short messages inside a small window and you want one response with full context. Compared to `debounce`, `burst` keeps the earlier messages in `context.skipped` instead of dropping them, and it flushes queued messages that arrive while the handler is running.

Choose `debounce` when the latest message replaces earlier ones, like rapid corrections. Choose `burst` when earlier messages still matter, like "hey", "quick question", and then the actual question. The tradeoff is that even a lone message waits for `debounceMs` before the handler runs.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
const bot = new Chat({
  concurrency: { strategy: "burst", debounceMs: 1000 },
  // ...
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message, context) => {
  const turn = [...(context?.skipped ?? []), message]
    .map((m) => m.text)
    .join("\n\n");

  const response = await generateAIResponse(turn);
  await thread.post(response);
});
```

**Flow:**

```
A arrives  → acquire lock → enqueue A → sleep(debounceMs)
B arrives  → lock busy → enqueue B
C arrives  → lock busy → enqueue C
             ... debounceMs elapses ...
           → drain: [A, B, C] → handler(C, { skipped: [A, B] })
D arrives while C is running → lock busy → enqueue D
E arrives while C is running → lock busy → enqueue E
C done     → drain: [D, E] → handler(E, { skipped: [D] })
E done     → queue empty → release lock
```

### Debounce

The first message waits for `debounceMs`. Messages that arrive during that window replace the pending message, so only the **final message in the burst window** is processed.

This is particularly useful for platforms like **WhatsApp** and **Telegram** where users tend to send a flurry of short messages in quick succession instead of composing a single message - "hey", "quick question", "how do I reset my password?" arriving as three separate webhooks within a few seconds. Without debounce, the bot would respond to "hey" before the actual question even arrives. With debounce, the SDK waits briefly and processes only the final message in the window.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
const bot = new Chat({
  concurrency: { strategy: "debounce", debounceMs: 1500 },
  // ...
});
```


  WhatsApp and Telegram adapters default to `lockScope: "channel"`, so debounce applies to the entire conversation — not just a single thread.


**Flow:**

```
A arrives  → acquire lock → store A as pending → sleep(debounceMs)
B arrives  → lock busy → overwrite pending with B (A dropped)
C arrives  → lock busy → overwrite pending with C (B dropped)
             ... debounceMs elapses with no new message ...
           → process C → release lock
```

Debounce also works well for rapid corrections ("wait, I meant...") and multi-part messages on any platform.

### Concurrent

No locking at all. Every message is processed immediately in its own handler invocation. Use this for stateless handlers where thread ordering doesn't matter.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts"
const bot = new Chat({
  concurrency: "concurrent",
  // ...
});
```

## Configuration

For fine-grained control, pass a `ConcurrencyConfig` object instead of a strategy string:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
const bot = new Chat({
  concurrency: {
    strategy: "queue",
    maxQueueSize: 20,          // Max queued messages per thread (default: 10)
    onQueueFull: "drop-oldest", // or "drop-newest" (default: "drop-oldest")
    queueEntryTtlMs: 60_000,  // Discard stale entries after 60s (default: 90s)
  },
  // ...
});
```

### All options

| Option            | Strategies             | Default         | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `strategy`        | all                    | `"drop"`        | The concurrency strategy to use                                                  |
| `maxQueueSize`    | queue, burst           | `10`            | Maximum queued messages per thread                                               |
| `onQueueFull`     | queue, burst           | `"drop-oldest"` | Whether to evict the oldest or reject the newest message when the queue is full  |
| `queueEntryTtlMs` | queue, debounce, burst | `90000`         | TTL for queued entries in milliseconds. Expired entries are discarded on dequeue |
| `debounceMs`      | debounce, burst        | `1500`          | Debounce window in milliseconds                                                  |
| `maxConcurrent`   | concurrent             | `Infinity`      | Max concurrent handlers per thread                                               |


  `maxConcurrent` only applies to the `concurrent` strategy. Pairing it with any other strategy logs a warning and the value is ignored. Setting `maxConcurrent` to a value less than `1` throws at construction time — `0` would deadlock the strategy and is rejected up front.


## MessageContext

All handler types (`onNewMention`, `onSubscribedMessage`, `onNewMessage`) accept an optional `MessageContext` as their last parameter. It is populated when using the `queue` strategy for queued messages, and when using `burst` for a collapsed turn. A lone `burst` message receives `skipped: []` and `totalSinceLastHandler: 1`.

```typescript
interface MessageContext {
  /** Messages that arrived while the previous handler was running, in chronological order. */
  skipped: Message[];
  /** Total messages received since last handler ran (skipped.length + 1). */
  totalSinceLastHandler: number;
}
```

Existing handlers that don't use `context` are unaffected — the parameter is optional.

### Example: Pass all messages to an LLM

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message, context) => {
  // Combine skipped messages with the current one for full context
  const allMessages = [...(context?.skipped ?? []), message];

  const response = await generateAIResponse(
    allMessages.map((m) => m.text).join("\n\n")
  );
  await thread.post(response);
});
```

## Lock scope

By default, locks are scoped to the thread — messages in different threads are processed independently. For platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram where conversations happen at the channel level rather than in threads, the lock scope defaults to `"channel"`.

You can override this globally:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
const bot = new Chat({
  concurrency: "queue",
  lockScope: "channel", // or "thread" (default)
  // ...
});
```

Or resolve it dynamically per message:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
const bot = new Chat({
  concurrency: "queue",
  lockScope: ({ isDM, adapter }) => {
    // Use channel scope for DMs, thread scope for group channels
    return isDM ? "channel" : "thread";
  },
  // ...
});
```

## State adapter requirements

The `queue`, `debounce`, and `burst` strategies require three additional methods on your state adapter:

| Method                              | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enqueue(threadId, entry, maxSize)` | Atomically append a message to the thread's queue. Returns new depth.  |
| `dequeue(threadId)`                 | Pop the next (oldest) message from the queue. Returns `null` if empty. |
| `queueDepth(threadId)`              | Return the current number of queued messages.                          |

All built-in state adapters (`@chat-adapter/state-memory`, `@chat-adapter/state-redis`, `@chat-adapter/state-ioredis`) implement these methods. The Redis adapters use Lua scripts for atomicity.

## Observability

All strategies emit structured log events at `info` level:

| Event                    | Strategy               | Data                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `message-queued`         | queue, burst           | threadId, messageId, queueDepth                   |
| `message-dequeued`       | queue, debounce, burst | threadId, messageId, skippedCount for queue/burst |
| `message-dropped`        | drop, queue, burst     | threadId, messageId, reason                       |
| `message-expired`        | queue, debounce, burst | threadId, messageId                               |
| `message-superseded`     | debounce               | threadId, droppedId                               |
| `message-debouncing`     | debounce, burst        | threadId, messageId, debounceMs                   |
| `message-debounce-reset` | debounce               | threadId, messageId                               |

## Choosing a strategy

| Use case                                  | Strategy     | Why                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple bots, one-shot commands            | `drop`       | No complexity, no queue overhead                                                          |
| AI chatbots, customer support             | `queue`      | Never lose messages; handler sees full conversation context                               |
| AI chatbots with multi-message user turns | `burst`      | Wait for the idle burst window, then respond once with every message in that window       |
| WhatsApp/Telegram bots, rapid corrections | `debounce`   | Users send many short messages in quick succession; wait briefly and keep only the latest |
| Stateless lookups, translations           | `concurrent` | Maximum throughput, no ordering needed                                                    |

## Backward compatibility

* The default strategy is `drop` — existing behavior is unchanged.
* The deprecated `onLockConflict` option continues to work but should be replaced with `concurrency`.
* Handler signatures are backward-compatible; the new `context` parameter is optional.
* Deduplication always runs regardless of strategy.
