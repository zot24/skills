# Liveblocks


## Install


## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";
import {
  createLiveblocksAdapter,
  type LiveblocksAdapter,
} from "@liveblocks/chat-sdk-adapter";

const bot = new Chat<{ liveblocks: LiveblocksAdapter }>({
  userName: "MyBot",
  adapters: {
    liveblocks: createLiveblocksAdapter({
      apiKey: process.env.LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY,
      webhookSecret: process.env.LIVEBLOCKS_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
      botUserId: "my-bot-user",
      botUserName: "MyBot",
    }),
  },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.adapter.addReaction(thread.id, message.id, "👀");
  await thread.post(`Hello, ${message.author.userName}!`);
});
```

The adapter maps Liveblocks rooms to Chat SDK channels, comment threads to Chat SDK threads, and individual comments to messages, so subscriptions, handlers, posts, and reactions work as they do with any other adapter.

## Platform setup

1. Create a [Liveblocks project](https://liveblocks.io/docs/get-started) with rooms using [Comments](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/comments).
2. In the dashboard, copy a secret key (`sk_...`) for server-side REST API calls.
3. Create a webhook signing secret (`whsec_...`) and configure webhooks to subscribe to:
   * `commentCreated`
   * `commentReactionAdded`
   * `commentReactionRemoved`
4. Choose a stable `botUserId` that matches how your app identifies users. It can be a real user ID in your system or a dedicated bot ID you issue.

Point your Liveblocks webhook URL at the route that forwards requests to `bot.webhooks.liveblocks` (see [Webhooks](#webhooks)).

## Configuration


Resolver return types follow the `@liveblocks/core` user and group metadata shapes (`U["info"]`, `DGI`).

## Webhooks

The adapter handles these Liveblocks webhook events:

| Event                    | Role                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `commentCreated`         | Drives Chat SDK message processing |
| `commentReactionAdded`   | Drives reaction handlers           |
| `commentReactionRemoved` | Drives reaction handlers           |

Forward webhook requests to `bot.webhooks.liveblocks`:

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/liveblocks/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  return bot.webhooks.liveblocks(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

The adapter verifies each request's signature with `webhookSecret` and returns `401` for an invalid request. Passing `waitUntil` lets work continue after the response is sent in serverless environments such as Vercel.

## Resolving mentions

When comments contain @mentions, supply `resolveUsers`, and optionally `resolveGroupsInfo`, so the adapter can resolve the mentioned IDs:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
const adapter = createLiveblocksAdapter({
  apiKey: process.env.LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY,
  webhookSecret: process.env.LIVEBLOCKS_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  botUserId: "my-bot-user",

  resolveUsers: async ({ userIds }) => {
    const users = await getUsersFromDatabase(userIds);
    return users.map((user) => ({
      name: user.fullName,
      avatar: user.avatarUrl,
    }));
  },

  resolveGroupsInfo: async ({ groupIds }) => {
    const groups = await getGroupsFromDatabase(groupIds);
    return groups.map((group) => ({ name: group.displayName }));
  },
});
```

## Message format

Liveblocks Comments use a simpler body model than full Markdown. The adapter converts outbound Chat SDK content and flattens structure that the body model can't represent.

Comment bodies support paragraphs with bold, italic, code, strikethrough, links, and @mentions of users and groups.

The adapter flattens headings, bullet and numbered lists, code blocks, tables, and raw HTML to plain text or paragraphs. Tables render as ASCII inside a paragraph. Card payloads become markdown or plain text, or their `fallbackText`, and lose their interactivity.

## Reactions

Pass Unicode emoji directly, or names such as `thumbs_up` that normalize to emoji where supported. Unknown custom IDs can fail API validation:

```typescript
await thread.adapter.addReaction(thread.id, message.id, "👍");
await thread.adapter.addReaction(thread.id, message.id, "thumbs_up");
```

## Thread IDs

Thread IDs take the form `liveblocks:{roomId}:{threadId}`, and channel IDs take the form `liveblocks:{roomId}`.

### `encodeThreadId`

```typescript
adapter.encodeThreadId(data: { roomId: string; threadId: string }): string;
```

```typescript
const encoded = adapter.encodeThreadId({
  roomId: "my-room",
  threadId: "th_abc123",
});
// "liveblocks:my-room:th_abc123"
```

### `decodeThreadId`

```typescript
adapter.decodeThreadId(threadId: string): { roomId: string; threadId: string };
```

Throws if the format is invalid. Room IDs may contain `:` because the last `:` separates the `threadId`, which means Liveblocks thread IDs themselves must not contain `:`.
