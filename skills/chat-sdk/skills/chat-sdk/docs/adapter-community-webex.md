# Webex


## Install


## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createWebexAdapter } from "@bitbasti/chat-adapter-webex";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";

export const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    webex: createWebexAdapter({
      botToken: process.env.WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN,
      webhookSecret: process.env.WEBEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
    }),
  },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`Hello from Webex! You said: ${message.text}`);
});
```

The memory state adapter keeps subscriptions and locks in process memory, which suits local development. Use [Redis](/adapters/official/redis) or [PostgreSQL](/adapters/official/postgres) in production.

Then create the webhook route:

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/webex/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  return bot.webhooks.webex(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

## Platform setup

1. Go to the [Webex Developer Portal](https://developer.webex.com/) and sign in.
2. Navigate to **My Webex Apps → Create a New App → Create a Bot**.
3. Fill in the bot name, username, and icon, then click **Add Bot**.
4. Copy the **Bot Access Token** and use it as `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN`. Store it securely, because it is only shown once.
5. Create a webhook pointing to your server:
   * **Target URL:** `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/webex`
   * **Resource:** `messages` | **Event:** `created`
   * **Resource:** `attachmentActions` | **Event:** `created`
   * **Secret:** a random string, which you use as `WEBEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
6. Add the bot to a Webex space and mention it to verify the integration.

See the [Webex Webhooks Guide](https://developer.webex.com/messaging/docs/api/guides/webhooks) for details on webhook registration.

## Configuration


### Environment variables

| Variable               | Required    | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN`      | Yes         | Bot access token from the Webex Developer Portal                      |
| `WEBEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Recommended | Shared secret for webhook signature verification                      |
| `WEBEX_BASE_URL`       | No          | Override the Webex API base URL (default: `https://webexapis.com/v1`) |
| `WEBEX_BOT_USERNAME`   | No          | Override the bot display name                                         |

## Webhooks

The adapter verifies webhook signatures (HMAC-SHA1) with `webhookSecret`. Register webhooks for the `messages` and `attachmentActions` resources as described in [Platform setup](#platform-setup).

## Messages and threads

The bot responds to mentions and DMs. Messages support rich text (bold, italic, code, links) via Markdown and can include a file upload. Threads map to Webex parent IDs.

You can edit and delete messages the bot posted. Edits can change the text or card but can't add files; the adapter throws a `ValidationError` if an edit includes one.

## Cards and modals

Chat SDK cards render as Adaptive Cards with buttons, selects, radio selects, fields, and sections. Modals render as form cards with submit and close actions.

## Limitations

* Webex bot tokens don't support reactions. `addReaction` and `removeReaction` throw `NotImplementedError`.
* Typing indicators are not available in the Webex Messaging API.
* Only one file upload per message is supported.
* Cards and file uploads cannot be combined in the same message.
