# Discord


## Install


## Quick start


  The adapter auto-detects `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`, `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`, and `DISCORD_MENTION_ROLE_IDS` from the environment.


```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createDiscordAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/discord";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    discord: createDiscordAdapter(),
  },
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post("Hello from Discord!");
});
```

## Configuration


`botToken`, `publicKey`, and `applicationId` are required.

## Interaction flags

Discord slash commands are acknowledged with `DEFERRED_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE` before your handler posts the final response. Use the `interactionFlags` option to set Discord interaction flags on that initial deferred response.

Return Discord's `EPHEMERAL` flag to make the loading state and original interaction response visible only to the user who invoked the command:

```typescript
import {
  createDiscordAdapter,
  DiscordInteractionResponseFlag,
} from "@chat-adapter/discord";

createDiscordAdapter({
  interactionFlags: ({ command, interaction }) => {
    if (
      command === "/admin" ||
      interaction.member?.roles.includes("1457473602180878604")
    ) {
      return DiscordInteractionResponseFlag.Ephemeral;
    }

    return undefined;
  },
});
```

The callback receives the parsed command path, flattened option text, invoking user, normalized Chat SDK channel ID, and raw Discord interaction. Later calls to `event.channel.post()` continue through the normal Discord interaction response flow. Calls to `event.channel.postEphemeral()` still use the normal Chat SDK fallback behavior.

## Authentication

### 1. Create the application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click **New Application**.
2. Note the **Application ID** and copy the **Public Key** from the General Information page.

### 2. Create the bot

1. Open **Bot** in the sidebar and click **Reset Token** to generate a bot token (you only see it once).
2. Enable **Message Content Intent** (and **Server Members Intent** if needed).

### 3. Set the interactions endpoint

In **General Information**, set **Interactions Endpoint URL** to `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/discord`. Discord sends a PING to verify.

### 4. Add the bot to your server

In **OAuth2** then **URL Generator**, select scopes `bot` and `applications.commands`, pick the permissions your bot needs (Send Messages, Send Messages in Threads, Create Public Threads, Read Message History, Add Reactions, Attach Files), and use the generated URL to invite the bot.

## Advanced

### HTTP Interactions vs Gateway

Discord has two ways to receive events:

* **HTTP Interactions** — receives button clicks, slash commands, and verification pings. Works on serverless. Does **not** receive regular messages.
* **Gateway WebSocket** — required to receive regular messages and reactions. Requires a persistent connection.

In serverless environments, use a cron job to keep the Gateway connection alive.

### Gateway setup for serverless

```typescript title="app/api/discord/gateway/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export const maxDuration = 800;

export async function GET(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;
  if (!cronSecret) {
    return new Response("CRON_SECRET not configured", { status: 500 });
  }

  const authHeader = request.headers.get("authorization");
  if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${cronSecret}`) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }

  const durationMs = 600 * 1000;
  const webhookUrl = `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}/api/webhooks/discord`;

  await bot.initialize();
  const discord = bot.getAdapter("discord");
  return discord.startGatewayListener(
    { waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task) },
    durationMs,
    undefined,
    webhookUrl
  );
}
```

```json title="vercel.json" lineNumbers
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/discord/gateway",
      "schedule": "*/9 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This runs every 9 minutes, overlapping with the 10-minute listener duration to keep coverage continuous.

### Role mentions

By default, only direct user mentions (`@BotName`) trigger `onNewMention` handlers. To also trigger on role mentions:

1. Create a role in your Discord server (e.g., "AI") and assign it to your bot.
2. Copy the role ID (right-click in server settings with Developer Mode enabled).
3. Add it to `mentionRoleIds`:

```typescript
createDiscordAdapter({
  mentionRoleIds: ["1457473602180878604"],
});
```

Or set `DISCORD_MENTION_ROLE_IDS` as a comma-separated string.
