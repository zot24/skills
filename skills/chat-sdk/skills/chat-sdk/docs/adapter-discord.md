# Discord


## Install


## Quick start


  The adapter auto-detects `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`, `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`, and `DISCORD_MENTION_ROLE_IDS` from the environment.

  For managed credentials and webhook verification, see [Vercel Connect](#vercel-connect).


```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createDiscordAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/discord";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";

const discord = createDiscordAdapter();
export const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    discord,
  },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post("Hello from Discord!");
});
```

The memory state adapter keeps subscriptions and locks in process memory, which suits local development. Use [Redis](/adapters/official/redis) or [PostgreSQL](/adapters/official/postgres) in production.

Then create the webhook route:

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/discord/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  return bot.webhooks.discord(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

## Platform setup

These steps create your own Discord application and bot, which you need when you [authenticate with Discord app credentials](#discord-app-credentials).

### 1. Create the application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click **New Application**.
2. Note the **Application ID** and copy the **Public Key** from the General Information page.

### 2. Create the bot

1. Open **Bot** in the sidebar and click **Reset Token** to generate a bot token. Discord shows the token only once.
2. Enable **Message Content Intent**, and **Server Members Intent** if your bot needs it.

### 3. Set the interactions endpoint

In **General Information**, set **Interactions Endpoint URL** to `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/discord`. Discord sends a PING to verify the endpoint.

### 4. Add the bot to your server

In **OAuth2** then **URL Generator**, select the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes, pick the permissions your bot needs (Send Messages, Send Messages in Threads, Create Public Threads, Manage Threads, Read Message History, Add Reactions, Attach Files), and use the generated URL to invite the bot.

## Authentication

### Vercel Connect

Use [Vercel Connect](/docs/vercel-connect) to resolve the bot token and application ID from a Discord connector and verify trigger-forwarded interactions with Vercel OIDC:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { createDiscordAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/discord";
import { connectDiscordAdapter } from "@vercel/connect/chat";

const discord = createDiscordAdapter({
  ...connectDiscordAdapter("discord/acme-discord"),
});
```

Replace `discord/acme-discord` with your connector UID. The helper supplies `botToken`, `applicationId`, and `webhookVerifier`, so you don't need `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`, or `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` in your deployment. Configure the Connect trigger to forward interactions to `/api/webhooks/discord` on your deployed app.

Connect OIDC verification replaces Discord's Ed25519 public-key check for forwarded interactions. Regular messages and reactions still require a [Gateway connection](#http-interactions-vs-gateway).

### Discord app credentials

Set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`, and `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` from the application you created in [Platform setup](#platform-setup), and the adapter picks them up automatically.

## Configuration


`botToken` and `applicationId` are required. Provide either `publicKey` or
`webhookVerifier`.

## HTTP Interactions vs Gateway

Discord delivers events over two channels:

* HTTP Interactions deliver button clicks, slash commands, and verification pings. They work on serverless but do not include regular messages.
* The Gateway WebSocket is required to receive regular messages and reactions, and it needs a persistent connection.

In serverless environments, use a cron job to keep the Gateway connection alive.

## Gateway setup for serverless

```typescript title="app/api/discord/gateway/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export const maxDuration = 800;

export async function GET(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;
  if (!cronSecret) {
    return new Response("CRON_SECRET not configured", { status: 500 });
  }

  const authHeader = request.headers.get("authorization");
  if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${cronSecret}`) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }

  const durationMs = 600 * 1000;
  const webhookUrl = `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}/api/webhooks/discord`;

  await bot.initialize();
  const discord = bot.getAdapter("discord");
  return discord.startGatewayListener(
    { waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task) },
    durationMs,
    undefined,
    webhookUrl
  );
}
```

```json title="vercel.json" lineNumbers
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/discord/gateway",
      "schedule": "*/9 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This runs every 9 minutes, overlapping with the 10-minute listener duration to keep coverage continuous.

## Role mentions

By default, only direct user mentions (`@BotName`) trigger `onNewMention` handlers. To also trigger on role mentions:

1. Create a role in your Discord server (for example, "AI") and assign it to your bot.
2. Copy the role ID. With Developer Mode enabled, right-click the role in server settings.
3. Add it to `mentionRoleIds`:

```typescript
createDiscordAdapter({
  mentionRoleIds: ["1457473602180878604"],
});
```

Or set `DISCORD_MENTION_ROLE_IDS` as a comma-separated string.

## Cards

Discord cards render as embeds by default. Set `contentFormat` to render Chat SDK cards with [Discord Components](https://docs.discord.com/developers/components/reference):

```typescript
import {
  createDiscordAdapter,
  DiscordContentFormat,
} from "@chat-adapter/discord";

createDiscordAdapter({
  contentFormat: DiscordContentFormat.ComponentsV2,
});
```

When enabled, card messages use Discord's `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` flag and render with containers, sections, text displays, media galleries, buttons, and string selects. Plain text messages continue to use normal Discord message content.

Discord caps a Components v2 message at 40 total components and 4000 characters across all text. When a card exceeds either limit the adapter throws a `ValidationError` instead of letting Discord reject the request, so reduce the number of sections, fields, actions, or images, or shorten the text on very large cards.

## Interaction flags

Discord slash commands are acknowledged with `DEFERRED_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE` before your handler posts the final response. Use the `interactionFlags` option to set Discord interaction flags on that initial deferred response.

Return Discord's `EPHEMERAL` flag to make the loading state and original interaction response visible only to the user who invoked the command:

```typescript
import {
  createDiscordAdapter,
  DiscordInteractionResponseFlag,
} from "@chat-adapter/discord";

createDiscordAdapter({
  interactionFlags: ({ command, interaction }) => {
    if (
      command === "/admin" ||
      interaction.member?.roles.includes("1457473602180878604")
    ) {
      return DiscordInteractionResponseFlag.Ephemeral;
    }

    return undefined;
  },
});
```

The callback receives the parsed command path, flattened option text, invoking user, normalized Chat SDK channel ID, and raw Discord interaction. Later calls to `event.channel.post()` continue through the normal Discord interaction response flow. Calls to `event.channel.postEphemeral()` still use the normal Chat SDK fallback behavior.

## Discord thread channel names

Call `discord.setThreadTitle(thread.id, title)` to rename an existing Discord thread channel. The bot needs the **Manage Threads** permission.

## Inbound attachments

Incoming attachments expose a lazy `fetchData()` that downloads from Discord's CDN anonymously. Downloads refuse private and internal addresses, including after redirects, are limited to 25 MB, and time out after 30 seconds.
