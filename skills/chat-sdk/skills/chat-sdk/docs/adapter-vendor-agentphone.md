# AgentPhone


## Install


## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { MemoryStateAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";
import { createAgentPhoneAdapter } from "@agentphone/chat-sdk-adapter";

const agentphone = createAgentPhoneAdapter({
  // apiKey: "...",          // or set AGENTPHONE_API_KEY
  // agentId: "agent_...",   // or set AGENTPHONE_AGENT_ID
  // webhookSecret: "whsec_...", // or set AGENTPHONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
});

export const chat = new Chat({
  userName: "my-bot",
  adapters: { agentphone },
  state: new MemoryStateAdapter(),
});

// Handles SMS, MMS, iMessage, and voice call transcripts
chat.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post(`Got your message: ${message.text}`);
});

chat.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`Reply: ${message.text}`);
});
```

Then create the webhook route:

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/agentphone/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { chat } from "@/lib/bot";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  return chat.webhooks.agentphone(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

Point your AgentPhone webhook at this route's deployed URL, and set `AGENTPHONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` so the adapter can verify each request. See [Webhooks](#webhooks).

## Configuration


### Environment variables

| Variable                    | Required                 | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENTPHONE_API_KEY`        | Yes                      | AgentPhone API key. Overridden by `config.apiKey`.            |
| `AGENTPHONE_AGENT_ID`       | Yes                      | Agent ID. Overridden by `config.agentId`.                     |
| `AGENTPHONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | For webhook verification | Webhook signing secret. Overridden by `config.webhookSecret`. |

## Webhooks

The adapter handles three webhook event types:

| Event              | Description                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `agent.message`    | Inbound SMS, MMS, or iMessage        |
| `agent.call_ended` | Voice call completed with transcript |
| `agent.reaction`   | iMessage tapback reaction            |

AgentPhone signs each webhook with HMAC-SHA256. Copy the signing secret from your [AgentPhone webhook configuration](https://docs.agentphone.ai/documentation/guides/webhooks) into `AGENTPHONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. With a secret set, the adapter returns `401` for a request with a missing or invalid signature, or with a timestamp outside a 5-minute window, which blocks replayed deliveries.


  Without a signing secret, the adapter accepts unsigned requests. Set one before you expose the route publicly.


## Channels

One adapter handles all four AgentPhone channels:

| Channel  | Send | Receive     | Media | Reactions |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ----- | --------- |
| SMS      | Yes  | Yes         | --    | --        |
| MMS      | Yes  | Yes         | Yes   | --        |
| iMessage | Yes  | Yes         | Yes   | Yes       |
| Voice    | --   | Transcripts | --    | --        |

Inbound SMS, MMS, and iMessage messages arrive as `onNewMention` or `onSubscribedMessage` events. A voice call arrives as a message containing the full transcript and summary after the call ends.

## iMessage reactions

Send an iMessage tapback with `addReaction`:

```typescript
// Send a tapback reaction to a message
await chat.adapters.agentphone.addReaction(threadId, messageId, "love");
```

Supported tapbacks: `love`, `like`, `dislike`, `laugh`, `emphasize`, `question`. Newer devices also accept custom emoji reactions such as `🔥`.

When a user reacts to a message, the adapter fires your `onReaction` handler.

## Voice call transcripts

When a voice call ends, AgentPhone delivers the full transcript as a message. Check `message.raw.callId` to tell a transcript apart from a text message:

```typescript
chat.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  if (message.raw.callId) {
    // This is a voice call transcript
    console.log("Call summary:", message.raw.summary);
    console.log("Transcript:", message.raw.transcript);
    console.log("Duration:", message.raw.durationSeconds, "seconds");
  }
});
```

## Limitations

SMS and voice constrain what the adapter can do:

* `editMessage` and `deleteMessage` aren't supported, because an SMS can't be changed after it's sent.
* `removeReaction` isn't supported.
* `startTyping` is a no-op, because SMS has no typing indicator.
* Streaming isn't supported.
