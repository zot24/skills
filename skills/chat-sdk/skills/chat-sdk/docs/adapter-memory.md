# Memory


  The memory adapter is for local development and testing only. State is lost on restart, and distributed locks don't work across multiple instances. Use [`@chat-adapter/state-redis`](/adapters/official/redis), [`@chat-adapter/state-ioredis`](/adapters/official/ioredis), or [`@chat-adapter/state-pg`](/adapters/official/postgres) in production.


## Install


## Quick start

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: { /* ... */ },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});
```

`createMemoryState()` takes no arguments. Subscriptions, locks, and cache live in the current process and disappear when the process exits.

## When to use

* Local development against `pnpm --filter docs dev` or your example app.
* Unit tests that need a real `StateAdapter` interface without a Redis or Postgres dependency.
* Quick prototypes where persistence isn't on the critical path.
