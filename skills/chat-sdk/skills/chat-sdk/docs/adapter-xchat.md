# XChat


## Install


## Quick start


  The adapter auto-detects `XCHAT_BOT_TOKEN`, `XCHAT_PIN`, and `X_CONSUMER_SECRET` from the environment. The bot's user id and @handle are resolved from `GET /2/users/me` at startup.


```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createXchatAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/x/chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    xchat: createXchatAdapter(),
  },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});

bot.onDirectMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});

bot.onNewMention(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.post(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});
```

The memory state adapter keeps subscriptions and locks in process memory, which suits local development. Use [Redis](/adapters/official/redis) or [PostgreSQL](/adapters/official/postgres) in production.

Route both GET and POST through the adapter. See [Webhooks](#webhooks) for what each method handles.

```typescript title="app/api/webhooks/xchat/route.ts" lineNumbers
import { after } from "next/server";
import { bot } from "@/lib/bot";

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return bot.webhooks.xchat(request);
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  return bot.webhooks.xchat(request, {
    waitUntil: (task) => after(() => task),
  });
}
```

## XChat adapter vs X adapter

The [`@chat-adapter/x`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chat-adapter/x) package contains two adapters for different X surfaces. This page covers the XChat adapter. For public posts, mentions, and classic DMs, use the [X adapter](/adapters/official/x).

You can register both adapters on the same `Chat` instance if your bot needs public posts and DMs as well as encrypted XChat.

## Platform setup

### 1. Register encryption keys

The bot account needs registered public keys and a Juicebox-backed private-key store before it can participate in encrypted conversations:

1. Generate keypairs with [`chat-xdk`](https://github.com/xdevplatform/chat-xdk) (`generateKeypairs()`).
2. Register them via `POST /2/users/{id}/public_keys`.
3. Store the private keys in Juicebox with a PIN (`chat.setup(pin)`).

The adapter unlocks the keys at startup with the same PIN (`XCHAT_PIN`). Registration is a one-time step per account.

### 2. Create a webhook

Register a webhook URL so the [X Activity API](https://docs.x.com/x-api/activity/introduction) can deliver events:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.x.com/2/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $APP_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/xchat"}'
```

X validates the URL with a CRC challenge, so the endpoint must be live before you create the webhook. Webhooks and activity subscriptions can also be managed in the [X Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard).

### 3. Subscribe to chat events

Create [activity subscriptions](https://docs.x.com/x-api/activity/create-x-activity-subscription) for the bot user with the bot's OAuth 2.0 user token:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.x.com/2/activity/subscriptions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOT_USER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "chat.received",
    "filter": {"user_id": "YOUR_BOT_USER_ID"},
    "tag": "bot-chat-received",
    "webhook_id": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID"
  }'
```

Subscribe to `chat.conversation_join` as well if you want the bot to post a welcome message when it is added to a group.

## Webhooks

The route handles two kinds of request from X:

* GET CRC challenge: the adapter answers with an HMAC-SHA256 of the token keyed by your app's consumer secret. Routing GET through the adapter lets it constrain CRC tokens before signing them.
* POST event delivery: the adapter verifies the `x-twitter-webhooks-signature` header against `X_CONSUMER_SECRET`.

## Encryption

Every XChat conversation is encrypted, and the adapter handles the whole crypto lifecycle: conversation-key extraction and caching, message decryption and signature verification, and encryption and signing on send. Conversation keys arrive through `KeyChange` events and are cached per conversation and key version. Incoming message signatures are verified against participants' signing keys; with `verifySignatures: true` (the default), unverifiable messages are dropped. Media is encrypted separately from message text using streaming encryption.

## Mention behavior in groups

`bot.onNewMention(handler)` fires for group messages that mention the bot. A group message counts as a mention when its rich-text mention entities include the bot's @handle or user ID, when it is a swipe-reply to one of the bot's own messages, or when its plain text contains `@handle` (fallback when no entities are present). To reply to every group message instead, register a catch-all `bot.onNewMessage(/.+/, handler)`.

## Open DM

`openDM(userId)` reuses an existing conversation or runs a fresh key exchange so the bot can message first. It requires the recipient to have encrypted chat set up, and the server requires the recipient to trust the bot (for example, follow it) before the first message is accepted.

## Formatting

XChat clients do not render markdown, so outgoing markdown appears literally as plain text. The adapter detects URLs and @mentions in outgoing text and renders them as tappable links and mention pills. Tables render as ASCII code blocks. Cards degrade to text with URL and mention entities plus a URL preview attachment: the first `x.com/.../status/...` URL in outgoing text auto-attaches as a post card.

## Read receipts and typing

A read receipt is sent for each delivered inbound message before handlers run unless `sendReadReceipts: false`. To control the timing yourself, disable automatic receipts and call `thread.markAsRead()` in the handler. XChat advances the conversation's read watermark through the target message sequence. The typing indicator is re-sent every 3 seconds while a handler runs.

```typescript
const xchat = createXchatAdapter({ sendReadReceipts: false });

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: { xchat },
});

bot.onDirectMessage(async (thread) => {
  await thread.markAsRead();
});
```

Automatic receipts never interrupt a handler, since a failure is logged and swallowed. A `thread.markAsRead()` call you make yourself rejects on failure, so await it or attach a `.catch()`.

When a delivered message has no sequence id, such as an event the adapter could not decrypt, the watermark advances to the latest event in the conversation. When only an explicit message id is available, the adapter replays recent history and rejects if it cannot resolve that exact message rather than advancing through newer messages.

## Edits, deletes, and streaming

The adapter can edit and delete only the bot's own messages. The first edit of a fresh message is held until the message is `editSafetyDelayMs` old (default 5000ms), so receiving clients have stored the original before the edit arrives. Deletes are delete-for-all. Streaming works through message edits, but the age gate makes rapid token-by-token updates coarse.

## Thread IDs

```
xchat:{conversationId}
```

* 1:1 conversations: `xchat:1234567890-9876543210` (both participant IDs)
* Group conversations: `xchat:g123456789` (opaque `g`-prefixed ID)

REST paths use the other participant's user ID for 1:1 conversations and the `g...` ID for groups; the adapter converts automatically.
