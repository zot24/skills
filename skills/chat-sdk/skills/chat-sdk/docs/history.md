# History


The History API gives you three scopes for reading and persisting message history — keyed by user, thread, or channel. The **user** scope is stored in your state adapter; **thread** history uses platform APIs with an optional state-backed cache; **channel** history reads from the platform via adapter methods.

| Scope   | Access                | Keyed by                | Typical use                                       |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| User    | `bot.history.user`    | Cross-platform user key | LLM context, audit trail, GDPR                    |
| Thread  | `bot.history.thread`  | Thread ID               | Backfill for adapters without server-side history |
| Channel | `bot.history.channel` | Channel ID              | Channel-level summaries, moderation               |


  `bot.history` is the unified successor to `bot.transcripts`. The user scope is a drop-in replacement. See [Migrating from `bot.transcripts`](#migrating-from-bottranscripts) below.


## Setup

All three scopes are available once you configure a state adapter and — for the user scope — an `identity` resolver:

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createSlackAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/slack";
import { createDiscordAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/discord";
import { createRedisState } from "@chat-adapter/state-redis";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    slack: createSlackAdapter(),
    discord: createDiscordAdapter(),
  },
  state: createRedisState({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL! }),

  history: {
    user: {
      // Required — maps each inbound message to a stable cross-platform key.
      // Return null to skip persistence for that message.
      identity: ({ author }) => author.email ?? null,

      // Storage tuning. retention is the list TTL, refreshed on every append.
      retention: "30d",
      maxPerUser: 200,
    },
  },
});
```

`history.user` requires an identity resolver — set `history.user.identity`, or keep the deprecated top-level `identity` field during migration. Omitting both when `history.user` (or legacy `transcripts`) is set throws at construction.

Thread and channel scopes are always available on `bot.history`. The **thread cache** (for adapters with `persistThreadHistory: true`, e.g. Telegram and WhatsApp) is tuned via `history.thread`:

```typescript
const bot = new Chat({
  // ...
  history: {
    thread: {
      maxMessages: 200,
      ttlMs: 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 14 days
    },
  },
});
```

## User history

`bot.history.user` stores a per-user transcript keyed by a stable cross-platform identifier. The same user can talk to your bot on Slack and Discord and see the same accumulated history.

### Building LLM context

The most common pattern: append the user's message, build a prompt from recent history, post the reply, then append the reply.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, msg) => {
  await bot.history.user.append(thread, msg);

  const recent = await bot.history.user.list({
    userKey: msg.userKey!,
    limit: 20,
  });

  const reply = await generateReply(recent, msg);
  await thread.post(reply);

  await bot.history.user.append(
    thread,
    { role: "assistant", text: reply },
    { userKey: msg.userKey! }
  );
});
```

Key things to know:

* **`msg.userKey`** is set automatically by the SDK from your `identity` resolver before your handler runs. If the resolver returned `null`, it remains `undefined` and `append` is a no-op.
* **Bot replies are explicit.** The SDK does not auto-capture `thread.post()` output — you decide what gets persisted. This matters for retries and intermediate streaming chunks.
* **Order is chronological.** `list` returns oldest-first, ready to feed into a model. Use `limit` to keep prompts bounded.

### Filtering entries

```typescript
// Recent 50 across all platforms (default)
await bot.history.user.list({ userKey: "mike@acme.com" });

// Newest 20 only
await bot.history.user.list({ userKey: "mike@acme.com", limit: 20 });

// Single platform
await bot.history.user.list({ userKey: "mike@acme.com", platforms: ["slack"] });

// Single thread
await bot.history.user.list({
  userKey: "mike@acme.com",
  threadId: "slack:C123:1234.5678",
});

// Only the user's own messages
await bot.history.user.list({ userKey: "mike@acme.com", roles: ["user"] });
```

### Deleting a user's history

For GDPR data-subject requests or "forget me" flows:

```typescript
await bot.history.user.delete({ userKey: "mike@acme.com" });
// → { deleted: 47 }
```

This wipes every entry stored under the key. Single-entry and time-range deletes are not supported — the underlying `appendToList` primitive cannot support them safely under concurrent writes.

## Thread history

`bot.history.thread` caches messages per thread. It is used internally by adapters that lack server-side message history APIs and set `persistThreadHistory: true` (Telegram, WhatsApp). For those adapters, reads are served from the cache; for everything else, the platform response is authoritative.

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  // bot.history.thread.list() handles both cases — it delegates to
  // adapter.fetchMessages, and on adapters that persist history in the
  // SDK-maintained cache (persistThreadHistory) serves it from there.
  const { messages } = await bot.history.thread.list(thread.id, { limit: 20 });

  const reply = await generateReply(messages, message);
  await thread.post(reply);
});
```


  Thread history is populated automatically when `adapter.persistThreadHistory` is `true`. You don't need to append manually. For adapters with server-side history (Slack, Teams, Discord), prefer `thread.messages` or `adapter.fetchMessages`.


## Channel history

`bot.history.channel` provides channel-level reads: top-level messages and thread listings. It delegates to the adapter — methods throw when the adapter doesn't implement the underlying capability (for example, `listThreads` on WhatsApp).

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  const channelId = thread.channelId;

  const { messages } = await bot.history.channel.listMessages(channelId, {
    limit: 10,
  });

  const { threads } = await bot.history.channel.listThreads(channelId, {
    limit: 20,
  });

  const reply = await generateChannelSummary(messages, threads);
  await thread.post(reply);
});
```

## Identity resolution

The identity resolver can live on `history.user.identity` (preferred) or the deprecated top-level `ChatConfig.identity` field. It runs once per inbound message:

```typescript
history: {
  user: {
    identity: async ({ adapter, author, message }) => {
      if (author.email) {
        return author.email;
      }
      // Map a platform user to an internal ID
      return await lookupUser(adapter, author.userId);
    },
    retention: "30d",
  },
}
```

Return `null` when you cannot resolve a key. The SDK will not fall back to a platform-specific ID — that would silently fragment a user's history across platforms.

If the resolver throws, the SDK logs a warning and dispatches the message without a `userKey`. Handlers still run; only the persistence is skipped.

## Migrating from `bot.transcripts`

`bot.transcripts` is deprecated in favour of `bot.history.user`. The API surface is identical — rename the config key and the call site:

```typescript
// Before
const bot = new Chat({
  identity: ({ author }) => author.email ?? null,
  transcripts: { retention: "30d", maxPerUser: 200 },
});

await bot.transcripts.append(thread, msg);
const entries = await bot.transcripts.list({ userKey, limit: 20 });
await bot.transcripts.delete({ userKey });

// After — identity on history.user (top-level identity still works during migration)
const bot = new Chat({
  history: {
    user: {
      identity: ({ author }) => author.email ?? null,
      retention: "30d",
      maxPerUser: 200,
    },
  },
});

await bot.history.user.append(thread, msg);
const entries = await bot.history.user.list({ userKey, limit: 20 });
await bot.history.user.delete({ userKey });
```

`bot.transcripts` continues to work and will not be removed in the current major version.

You can migrate one field at a time: when both `history.user` and the legacy `transcripts` block are set, they merge, with `history.user` winning field by field. Settings like `retention` and `maxPerUser` left on `transcripts` keep applying until you move them.

## Storage

User and thread **cache** scopes use `StateAdapter.appendToList` / `getList`. Channel scope reads from platform APIs and is not persisted in state by default.

| Scope                  | Storage / source                                  | Key or API                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User                   | State adapter                                     | `transcripts:user:{userKey}`                                   |
| Thread cache           | State adapter (when `persistThreadHistory: true`) | `msg-history:{threadId}`                                       |
| Thread / channel reads | Platform adapter                                  | `adapter.fetchMessages`, `fetchChannelMessages`, `listThreads` |

On channel-scoped platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram), inbound messages may also be appended under `msg-history:{channelId}` so channel-level iteration can fall back to the cache.

Appends to user/thread cache keys are atomic, so concurrent inbound messages on the same key don't race.
