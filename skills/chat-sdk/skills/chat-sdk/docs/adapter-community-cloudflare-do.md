# Cloudflare Durable Objects


## Install


## Quick start

```typescript title="src/index.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createSlackAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/slack";
import { ChatStateDO, createCloudflareState } from "chat-state-cloudflare-do";

// Re-export the Durable Object class so Cloudflare can find it.
export { ChatStateDO };

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
    const bot = new Chat({
      userName: "my-bot",
      adapters: { slack: createSlackAdapter() },
      state: createCloudflareState({ namespace: env.CHAT_STATE }),
    });
    return bot.webhooks.slack(request);
  },
};
```

### Wrangler configuration

Add the Durable Object binding and migration to your `wrangler.jsonc` (recommended) or `wrangler.toml`:

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [{ "name": "CHAT_STATE", "class_name": "ChatStateDO" }]
  },
  "migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["ChatStateDO"] }]
}
```

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
[durable_objects]
bindings = [
  { name = "CHAT_STATE", class_name = "ChatStateDO" }
]

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_sqlite_classes = ["ChatStateDO"]
```

### Environment type

Type the binding in your `Env` interface:

```typescript title="src/env.d.ts"
import type { ChatStateDO } from "chat-state-cloudflare-do";

interface Env {
  CHAT_STATE: DurableObjectNamespace<ChatStateDO>;
}
```

## Configuration


## Architecture

The adapter uses a single Durable Object class (`ChatStateDO`) with five SQLite tables, so it needs no external services such as Redis or a database:

* `subscriptions`: thread IDs the bot is subscribed to, persisted across deployments
* `locks`: distributed locks with token-based ownership and TTL
* `cache`: key-value pairs with optional TTL
* `queue`: thread-scoped FIFO queue entries with TTL for the queue and debounce concurrency strategies
* `lists`: ordered list entries for persistent message history

All operations are single-threaded within a DO instance, so distributed locking comes from DO atomicity rather than Lua scripts. Locks also support force-release for Chat SDK lock conflict handling. Expired entries are cleaned up automatically with the [Alarms API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/alarms/).

Each method call creates a fresh DO stub. Stubs are plain JavaScript objects and cheap to create, and the [Cloudflare docs recommend](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/error-handling/) creating new stubs rather than reusing them after errors.

## Sharding

A single Durable Object handles roughly 500–1000 requests per second. For high-traffic bots, use `shardKey` to distribute load across multiple DO instances:

```typescript
const state = createCloudflareState({
  namespace: env.CHAT_STATE,
  shardKey: (threadId) => threadId.split(":")[0], // one DO per platform
});
```

Locks, force-release, and queue operations are per-thread, so sharding by any prefix of the thread ID is safe. Cache and list operations (`get` / `set` / `delete`, `appendToList` / `getList`) always route to the default shard, because their keys are not thread-scoped.

| Strategy              | `shardKey`                                    | DOs created    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No sharding (default) | –                                             | 1              |
| Per platform          | `(id) => id.split(":")[0]`                    | 1 per platform |
| Per channel           | `(id) => id.split(":").slice(0, 2).join(":")` | 1 per channel  |

## Production notes

* Use [Smart Placement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) to co-locate your Worker with the DO.
* Monitor DO metrics in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
* Enable sharding if you expect more than \~500 req/s to a single DO instance.
* Use `locationHint` to place the DO near your primary user base and reduce latency.
