# Overview


The `chat/ai` subpath is the home for AI utilities that ship with Chat SDK.

```ts
import { createChatTools, toAiMessages } from "chat/ai";
```

Add the optional peers if you don't already have them:


## What's included

| Page                                      | What it gives you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [AI SDK Tools](/docs/ai/ai-sdk-tools)     | `createChatTools` and standalone tool factories that let an agent post messages, send DMs, react, edit, delete, and manage subscriptions across every adapter your `Chat` instance has registered. Built-in approval gates and presets keep writes safe. |
| [`toAiMessages`](/docs/ai/to-ai-messages) | Convert Chat SDK [`Message[]`](/docs/api/message) into the `{ role, content }[]` shape expected by AI SDK calls. Handles role mapping, attachments, links, sorting, and optional per-message transforms.                                                 |
| [Types](/docs/ai/types)                   | Reference for every type exported from `chat/ai` — agent message shapes, tool option contracts, presets, approval config, and the binding type that ties tools to your `Chat` instance.                                                                  |

## Typical flow

A Chat SDK bot wired to a tool-calling agent usually looks like this:

```typescript title="lib/agent.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createChatTools, toAiMessages } from "chat/ai";
import { ToolLoopAgent } from "ai";

const chat = new Chat({ /* adapters, state, ... */ });

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
  instructions: "You operate inside a chat workspace via Chat SDK tools.",
  tools: createChatTools({ chat, preset: "messenger", requireApproval: true }),
});

bot.onSubscribedMessage(async (thread) => {
  const { messages } = await thread.adapter.fetchMessages(thread.id, {
    limit: 20,
  });
  const history = await toAiMessages(messages);
  const result = await agent.stream({ prompt: history });
  await thread.post(result.fullStream);
});
```

1. [`toAiMessages`](/docs/ai/to-ai-messages) converts messages into an output compatible with AI SDK's `ModelMessage[]`.
2. [`createChatTools`](/docs/ai/ai-sdk-tools) gives the agent pre-built and fully customizable AI SDK tools.
3. The streamed response is rendered back into the thread via the standard [`thread.post(stream)`](/docs/streaming) flow.

## Backwards compatibility

`toAiMessages` and the related `Ai*` types are still re-exported from the top-level `chat` package so older bots keep working. Those re-exports are now flagged with `@deprecated` JSDoc — your editor will surface a hint pointing at `chat/ai`. Migrating is a one-line import change:

```diff
- import { toAiMessages } from "chat";
+ import { toAiMessages } from "chat/ai";
```
